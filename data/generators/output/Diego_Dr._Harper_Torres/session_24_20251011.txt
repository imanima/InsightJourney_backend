Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Diego, good morning. Glad you could make it today. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or noteworthy you'd like to start with?  

[11:03] Diego: Hey, Dr. Torres. Yeah, I think I’ve been okay. I’ve been trying to stick to the sleep routine we talked about, but honestly, some nights are still tough. I feel pretty anxious when I can't fall asleep right away.  

[11:07] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, especially when you’re under pressure with your studies. How has the sleep hygiene practice been working for you overall? Are you finding it easier to wind down?  

[11:09] Diego: It’s a bit mixed. I’ve started limiting screen time before bed, and that helps sometimes. But other nights, I still lie awake for a while, especially if I have a lot on my mind.  

[11:12] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. Remember, it’s normal for sleep to fluctuate, especially during stressful periods. Have you noticed if certain thoughts tend to keep you awake?  

[11:15] Diego: Yeah, mostly about upcoming deadlines or my research. I keep replaying what I could have done better or what I need to do next. It kind of spirals.  

[11:17] Dr. Torres: That’s a classic case of ruminative thinking. We’ve talked before about cognitive restructuring. Would you like to revisit some techniques to manage those thoughts?  

[11:20] Diego: Sure, I think I need that. It’s just hard to switch my mind off sometimes.  

[11:22] Dr. Torres: Absolutely. One approach is to challenge those thoughts—ask yourself, “Is this thought helpful or realistic right now?” For example, when you think, “I won’t finish my research in time,” how true is that?  

[11:25] Diego: Well, I guess I have made progress, but I still worry about meeting deadlines. Sometimes I feel like I’m behind, even if I’ve done a lot.  

[11:27] Dr. Torres: That’s a good observation. The perfectionist streak might be amplifying that feeling. How does that perfectionism affect your stress levels?  

[11:30] Diego: It’s definitely a big part of it. I want everything to be perfect, especially my work. If I make a small mistake, I get really anxious about it.  

[11:33] Dr. Torres: That’s common among ambitious students. One goal with perfectionism is to learn to accept “good enough” when appropriate. Would you be open to some exercises that help you practice that?  

[11:35] Diego: Yeah, I think that could help. I don’t want to get stuck in this cycle forever.  

[11:38] Dr. Torres: Great. We can try a brief mindfulness exercise now, focusing on accepting imperfections without judgment. (pauses) Would you like to do that?  

[11:40] Diego: Sure, let’s try.  

(Dr. Torres guides Diego through a 2-minute mindfulness exercise, focusing on breathing and observing thoughts without attachment.)  

[11:43] Dr. Torres: How did that feel?  

[11:44] Diego: It was different. My mind kept wandering, but I noticed the thoughts more clearly. I guess it’s about practicing regularly.  

[11:46] Dr. Torres: Exactly. Consistency helps in building that acceptance. Now, shifting gears a little—how are your social interactions going? You mentioned feeling anxious in new environments.  

[11:50] Diego: Yeah, I’ve been trying to push myself to say hi to classmates or join study groups, but it’s still pretty intimidating. I get nervous about saying the wrong thing or just standing there awkwardly.  

[11:53] Dr. Torres: That’s a common feeling. Last time, we discussed exposure techniques. Have you tried any deliberate social exposures since then?  

[11:55] Diego: I attended one study group last week, even though I was really nervous. I managed to contribute a bit, but I felt pretty anxious afterward.  

[11:58] Dr. Torres: That’s a great step, Diego. Exposure is about gradual progress. How did you handle the anxiety during or after?  

[12:00] Diego: I told myself it was okay to feel nervous, and that everyone probably feels that way sometimes. It helped a little.  

[12:03] Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful self-compassion in action. Remember, each exposure is a building block. Over time, these experiences can reduce your social anxiety.  

[12:06] Diego: Yeah, I hope so. I really want to get more confident, especially since my program is so competitive.  

[12:08] Dr. Torres: Absolutely. And developing your social confidence will also support your academic goals. Speaking of which, how are you feeling about your research progress lately?  

[12:11] Diego: It’s been a mix. I’ve automated part of my data analysis, which saves time, but I still feel overwhelmed sometimes trying to balance everything—classes, research, personal life.  

[12:14] Dr. Torres: That’s a lot to juggle. Have you been using any specific strategies to manage your time or reduce stress?  

[12:16] Diego: I’ve been trying to prioritize tasks with a to-do list, but I sometimes get distracted or procrastinate.  

[12:19] Dr. Torres: That’s common. We can explore some study and work organization techniques next time, maybe using the Pomodoro method or scheduling breaks.  

[12:21] Diego: Yeah, I think that could help. I tend to work in long blocks, and then I burn out.  

[12:24] Dr. Torres: Exactly. Shorter, focused sessions with breaks can improve both efficiency and well-being. For now, I’d like you to keep practicing your cognitive restructuring and social exposure exercises. Also, note any thoughts or feelings that come up during the week, especially those related to stress or perfectionism.  

[12:26] Diego: Will do. I’ll try to keep track with my mood app and journal a bit more.  

[12:29] Dr. Torres: Perfect. As always, I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Next session, we can review how these strategies are working and set some new goals. How does that sound?  

[12:31] Diego: Sounds good. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

[12:33] Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Diego. Take care until then, and remember, gradual progress counts. Have a good week.  

[12:35] Diego: Thanks, you too.
