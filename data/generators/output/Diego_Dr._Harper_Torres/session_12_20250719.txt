Date: July 19, 2025
Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Diego: Hey, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything—especially the research deadlines and trying to settle into the new environment here.

[11:05] Dr. Torres: That sounds like a lot to manage all at once. Last time, you mentioned feeling some social anxiety and stress about balancing your coursework and research. Have there been any particular moments where these feelings have been more intense?

[11:07] Diego: Yeah, especially during group meetings. I find myself hesitating to speak up, even when I have ideas. It’s like I’m worried about saying the wrong thing or not being good enough. It’s kind of frustrating because I know I’m capable, but I just get stuck.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: That’s a common experience, especially for someone who’s naturally analytical and perfectionistic. Remember, part of our work has been about challenging those critical thoughts. Have you noticed any specific thoughts popping up during those meetings?

[11:12] Diego: Yeah, I often think, “What if I say something stupid? Or they’ll think I don’t know enough.” It’s like I’m already convinced I’ll fail before I even try.

[11:15] Dr. Torres: That’s a very typical cognitive pattern—catastrophizing and self-doubt. Today, I’d like to explore some cognitive restructuring strategies to help you challenge and reframe those thoughts. Also, I want to check in on how your sleep has been lately since that can impact anxiety levels.

[11:17] Diego: Sleep’s been okay, I guess. Still not sleeping as well as I’d like. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. I think stress might be part of it.

[11:20] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, especially with your workload and adjustment period. We’ve worked on sleep hygiene before, but sometimes adding a mindfulness practice before bed can help. Would you like to do a quick mindfulness exercise now?

[11:22] Diego: Yeah, I’d like that.

[11:23] Dr. Torres: Great. Let’s try a brief body scan. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath. As you breathe out, focus your attention on the sensations in your body—starting from your toes up to your head. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort without judgment. (Pauses briefly) How does that feel?

[11:27] Diego: It’s sort of calming. I notice my shoulders are pretty tense, especially after sitting at my desk all morning.

[11:28] Dr. Torres: That’s a common tension point for many students. When you notice your shoulders or jaw tightening, try to gently relax those muscles. Practicing this regularly can help reduce overall stress and improve sleep quality over time. How does that sound for a nightly routine?

[11:30] Diego: I think I can try that. It’s simple enough. Sometimes I forget to wind down at night.

[11:32] Dr. Torres: It’s all about building consistency. Now, earlier you mentioned feeling hesitant to speak up in meetings. Have you tried any specific exposure strategies to gradually increase your confidence?

[11:34] Diego: Not really. I’ve been avoiding speaking up because I’m worried about messing up. But I guess I could try preparing a couple of points beforehand, just in case.

[11:37] Dr. Torres: That’s a great start. Preparing can give you a sense of control. Also, setting a small goal—like volunteering to share one idea in the next meeting—can help you build confidence gradually. Would you like to set a specific plan for that?

[11:39] Diego: Yeah, I think I can aim to contribute at least once next meeting. Maybe start with a question or comment about the research project.

[11:41] Dr. Torres: Perfect. And after you do it, take a moment to acknowledge your effort, regardless of the outcome. We’ve also discussed cognitive restructuring—what negative thoughts come up after you speak up, if any?

[11:43] Diego: Sometimes I think, “Did that sound stupid? Did I make sense?” I worry I’ll be judged if I say something wrong.

[11:45] Dr. Torres: Those are common fears. Let’s practice challenging that thought. What’s a more balanced way to look at it?

[11:47] Diego: Maybe, “I prepared what I wanted to say, and it’s okay if I stumble a bit. Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s part of learning.”

[11:50] Dr. Torres: Exactly. Reframing like that can reduce anxiety and help you take action. How does that feel?

[11:52] Diego: It feels better, actually. Like I have some control back.

[11:55] Dr. Torres: Great. Remember, progress is about small steps. Now, thinking about your future goals—what’s one thing you’d like to focus on before our next session?

[11:57] Diego: I want to keep practicing speaking up in meetings, even if it’s just asking a question. Also, I’d like to try that body scan every night before bed.

[12:00] Dr. Torres: Those are excellent goals. Before we finish, let’s briefly review your action plan: continue with the nightly mindfulness, challenge negative thoughts with the reframing we practiced, and aim to contribute once in your next meeting. Does that sound manageable?

[12:02] Diego: Yes, I think I can do that.

[12:03] Dr. Torres: Wonderful. I’ll see you next week, and we can check in on how the exposure and sleep routines are going. Remember, every small step counts.

[12:05] Diego: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate the support.

[12:07] Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Diego. Take care until then.
