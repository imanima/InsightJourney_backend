Session 11/24
Date: July 12, 2025
Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or events you'd like to share?

[11:05] Diego: Hey, Dr. Torres. Yeah, I think I’ve been okay. The week was pretty busy with research deadlines, but I managed to get some sleep last night, which was a relief. Still feeling a bit anxious about the upcoming presentation next week, though.

[11:07] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable—presentations can be stressful, especially when you're juggling a lot. You mentioned last time that preparing for these helps you feel more in control. How has your preparation been going?

[11:10] Diego: Actually, I’ve been breaking down the presentation into smaller parts, like we discussed, and working on one section at a time. It’s been helpful, but I notice I still get those waves of anxiety before reviewing my notes or rehearsing.

[11:12] Dr. Harper: That’s a common experience. When those waves hit, do you notice what thoughts come up? For example, do you think about failing or messing up?

[11:15] Diego: Yeah, I catch myself thinking I’ll forget everything or that I’ll embarrass myself in front of my peers. It’s like a loop of negative thoughts.

[11:17] Dr. Harper: Those are typical anxiety thoughts. Remember, part of our work involves recognizing these thoughts and challenging them with more balanced perspectives. Have you tried the cognitive restructuring exercises we discussed last time?

[11:20] Diego: I have, a bit. I tried to reframe the “I’ll forget everything” thought as “I’ve prepared well, and even if I stumble, it’s okay. I can handle it.” It helps sometimes, but I still feel the nerves.

[11:22] Dr. Harper: That’s progress. It’s normal for anxiety to linger, especially in high-pressure situations. Let’s also consider some relaxation techniques you can use right before your presentation—like deep breathing or mindfulness. Have you practiced those?

[11:25] Diego: I’ve done some deep breathing exercises in the past, but I haven’t used them much lately. Maybe I should review that.

[11:27] Dr. Harper: Absolutely. Incorporating a quick breathing exercise—like inhaling for four counts, holding for four, then exhaling for four—can help reduce physiological symptoms of anxiety. Would you like to do a brief practice now?

[11:30] Diego: Sure, I can try.

(Diego follows a guided breathing exercise led by Dr. Torres)

[11:35] Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?

[11:36] Diego: A bit calmer. It’s a simple tool, but it does seem to help me when I remember to use it.

[11:38] Dr. Harper: That’s great. Remember, the goal is to build these into your routine, especially during stressful moments. Now, shifting gears a little—how are your social confidence efforts going? Have you tried any social exposure activities since our last session?

[11:40] Diego: I’ve spoken with a few classmates more during study groups, but I still feel pretty shy. Sometimes I avoid making small talk or participating actively.

[11:43] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. Building social confidence takes time. One approach we can try is setting small, manageable goals—like initiating a brief chat or asking a question during study sessions. Have you considered practicing these in low-stakes situations?

[11:45] Diego: Yeah, I think I could try that. Maybe just saying “hi” or asking about the homework next time.

[11:47] Dr. Harper: Excellent. And remember, each small step counts. Also, noticing your successes, no matter how minor, can reinforce your confidence. We can also explore some mindfulness exercises to help you stay present in social situations if that’s helpful.

[11:50] Diego: That sounds good. I tend to overthink and get anxious about saying the wrong thing.

[11:52] Dr. Harper: Mindfulness can help you observe those thoughts without judgment and reduce the tendency to overthink. We can practice a brief mindfulness exercise now, focusing on your breath and sensations—would you like to try?

[11:55] Diego: Yeah, I’d like that.

(They do a short mindfulness exercise)

[12:00] Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?

[12:01] Diego: More grounded. It’s easier to stay present when I focus on my breathing.

[12:03] Dr. Harper: That’s great. Remember, these techniques are tools you can use anytime you notice your mind racing or your anxiety rising. Now, thinking about your overall goals—how are you progressing with your plan to excel in your research and prepare for the industry transition?

[12:05] Diego: I think I’ve been making progress. I set specific weekly goals for my research tasks and started reaching out to some professionals for advice. It’s a bit intimidating, but I’m trying to push through.

[12:08] Dr. Harper: That’s fantastic. Taking proactive steps like reaching out is a big move. How do you feel about your current pace and workload? Are you managing stress effectively?

[12:10] Diego: Honestly, I still feel a bit overwhelmed at times, especially when I have multiple deadlines, but I’m using the scheduling tools we talked about to stay organized. It helps.

[12:12] Dr. Harper: Organization and planning are key. Remember to also include breaks and self-care in your schedule to prevent burnout. How is your sleep lately? Last time, we discussed sleep hygiene strategies.

[12:15] Diego: It’s been better. I’ve been sticking to a regular bedtime and avoiding screens an hour before sleep. Still, sometimes my mind races with research ideas or worries.

[12:17] Dr. Harper: That’s common. When your mind is busy, a journaling routine before bed can help offload those thoughts. Do you want to try a quick journaling exercise now?

[12:20] Diego: Sure, I can do that.

(They briefly do a journaling activity focused on releasing thoughts and worries)

[12:25] Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?

[12:26] Diego: More relaxed. It’s like I’ve cleared some mental clutter.

[12:28] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Keep practicing that, especially on nights when your mind won’t settle. To wrap up, let’s summarize some action steps. You’ll continue using the cognitive restructuring for your presentation anxiety, practice the breathing and mindfulness techniques, initiate small social interactions, and incorporate journaling into your bedtime routine. Does that sound manageable?

[12:30] Diego: Yes, that sounds doable. I think these tools can really help.

[12:32] Dr. Harper: Great. For next week, let’s check in on how these strategies are working and explore any new challenges that come up. Remember, progress is a process, and you’re making meaningful steps.

[12:35] Diego: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate the support.

[12:37] Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Diego. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your continued progress. See you next week.
