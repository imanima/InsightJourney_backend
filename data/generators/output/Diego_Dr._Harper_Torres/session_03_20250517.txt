[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, good morning! How are you feeling today?  
(offers a warm smile)  
Anything particular on your mind since our last session?

[11:03] Diego: Hey, Dr. Torres. I’m doing okay. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the coursework and trying to get my research automation project off the ground. It’s like there’s never enough time.  

[11:05] Dr. Torres: That sounds tough. You mentioned last time feeling anxious about balancing your study work and research. How have you been managing that balance since our last session?  

[11:08] Diego: I’ve been trying to stick to a schedule, but sometimes I get stuck in analysis paralysis or I just procrastinate because I’m afraid I’ll mess up. I also notice I get really anxious when I think about presenting my research at the upcoming conference.  

[11:10] Dr. Torres: Those feelings are quite common, especially with high-pressure situations like conferences. It’s good you’re aware of the procrastination and anxiety. Let’s explore some ways to manage that stress and boost your confidence. Have you tried any specific strategies since our last talk?  

[11:12] Diego: I’ve started doing some breathing exercises you showed me, and I’ve been using a timer to break down my study sessions into smaller chunks. It helps a bit, but I still feel the pressure building up.  

[11:15] Dr. Torres: That’s great progress—using breathing and time management are solid tools. Sometimes, with anxiety about presentations, imagining the worst-case scenario can make things worse. Have you tried any cognitive restructuring to challenge those thoughts?  

[11:17] Diego: Not really in detail. I just keep thinking, “What if I forget what to say?” or “What if no one understands my work?”  

[11:20] Dr. Torres: Those are common fears. Let’s try to reframe them. For example, if you think, “What if I forget my presentation,” you might tell yourself, “I’ve prepared well, and even if I stumble, I can handle it.” Would you like to practice this together now?  

[11:22] Diego: Yeah, I think that could help.  

[11:23] Dr. Torres: Okay, let’s do a quick exercise. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Take a deep breath. Now, imagine the day of your presentation. What’s the worst thing that could happen?  

[11:25] Diego: (pauses, then speaks softly) I might forget a part of my slides or stumble over my words.  

[11:27] Dr. Torres: And how likely is that?  

[11:28] Diego: I guess not very. I’ve practiced a lot, so I’d probably be okay.  

[11:30] Dr. Torres: Exactly. And even if it happens, it’s not the end of the world. You can pause, take a breath, and keep going. Remember, your goal is to communicate your ideas, not deliver perfection. How does that reframing feel?  

[11:32] Diego: It makes me feel a bit more relaxed, like I don’t have to be perfect.  

[11:33] Dr. Torres: That’s a big step. Recognizing that imperfection is okay can really reduce your anxiety. Now, let’s talk about social confidence. You mentioned feeling shy in new environments. Have you had any opportunities or challenges with social interactions recently?  

[11:36] Diego: Yeah, I attended a couple of study group sessions but I mostly kept quiet. I want to be more involved, but I get nervous about saying the wrong thing or not knowing enough.  

[11:39] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Building social confidence takes practice. One approach is to set small goals—like asking one question or sharing one idea during each session. Have you tried that?  

[11:41] Diego: Not consistently. I usually just listen.  

[11:43] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Listening is valuable, but gradually sharing can help you feel more comfortable. Let’s create a simple plan: next time, try to ask one question or make one comment. When you do, notice how it feels. Would you be willing to try that before our next session?  

[11:45] Diego: Yeah, I can do that. It sounds manageable.  

[11:46] Dr. Torres: Great. Also, I want to check in on your sleep. Last time, you mentioned some difficulties falling asleep after studying late. Have you made any changes?  

[11:49] Diego: I’ve been trying to stick to a more consistent bedtime, and I avoid screens an hour before bed, but sometimes I still lie awake thinking about my research or deadlines.  

[11:52] Dr. Torres: That’s common. Sleep hygiene helps, but sometimes our minds need extra support. Have you tried any mindfulness or relaxation exercises before bed?  

[11:54] Diego: Not really. I’ve heard about meditation, but I find it hard to quiet my mind.  

[11:56] Dr. Torres: That’s normal. A simple technique is a body scan or progressive muscle relaxation. Would you like me to guide you through a quick exercise now?  

[11:58] Diego: Yes, please. That would be helpful.  

[12:00] Dr. Torres: Okay, let’s do a brief body scan. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes if you like, and take a deep breath. Focus on your toes—notice any sensations or tension. As you breathe out, imagine releasing that tension. Slowly move your attention up your body, relaxing each part... (guides through the exercise)  

[12:10] Diego: (sighs softly) I do feel a bit more relaxed.  

[12:12] Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful. Practicing this regularly can help calm your mind before sleep. To wrap up, let’s review your action items. You’ll practice reframing anxious thoughts about your presentation, ask one question in your study groups, and try the relaxation exercise before bed. How does that sound?  

[12:15] Diego: It sounds good. I think I can stick to that.  

[12:16] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Keep track of your feelings and progress with our app, and we’ll review how these strategies are working next week. Before we finish, is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?  

[12:18] Diego: Not right now. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel a bit more hopeful about managing everything.  

[12:20] Dr. Torres: That’s great to hear, Diego. Remember, progress is gradual, and you’re doing really well. See you next week—same time?  

[12:21] Diego: Yes, see you then. Thanks again.  

[12:22] Dr. Torres: Take care, Diego. Have a good week!
