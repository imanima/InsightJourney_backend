**[11:00]**  
**Dr. Harper Torres:** Hi Diego, good to see you again. How has your week been?  

**Diego:** Hi, Dr. Torres. It’s been okay, I guess. A bit stressful with exams coming up, but I’ve been trying to stick to the routines we discussed.  

**[11:05]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s good to hear you’re maintaining your routines. Last time, we talked about some stress management techniques and your goal to improve your social confidence. How have you been feeling overall?  

**Diego:** Honestly, a little more anxious than last week, especially when I think about the upcoming project deadlines and trying to balance research. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, like I’m not doing enough.  

**Dr. Harper:** That sounds tough. It’s common to feel overwhelmed with so many responsibilities, especially when you’re balancing research and coursework. Did you get a chance to practice any of the mindfulness exercises we discussed?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I tried the breathing exercise before my study sessions. It helped calm my nerves a bit, but I still find my mind racing when I’m trying to focus.  

**[11:10]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s a good start. Mindfulness takes consistent practice, so it’s normal for your mind to wander initially. Would you like to explore some ways to make those exercises more effective or maybe combine them with your study routines?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I think that would help. Sometimes I also get anxious about social situations, like talking to classmates or attending events. I feel like I’m awkward and worry I’ll say the wrong thing.  

**Dr. Harper:** Social anxiety is quite common, especially when adjusting to new environments. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up in those moments?  

**Diego:** Mostly, I think, “What if I embarrass myself?” or “They won’t want to talk to me.” I know it’s just my mind jumping to worst-case scenarios.  

**[11:15]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s a very perceptive observation. Recognizing those automatic thoughts is a crucial step. We can work on cognitive restructuring to challenge these beliefs. For example, what evidence do you have that you’ll embarrass yourself, or that others won’t want to talk to you?  

**Diego:** Well, I guess I don’t have much concrete evidence. It’s mostly assumptions based on past experiences of feeling shy or awkward. I think I tend to overgeneralize.  

**Dr. Harper:** Exactly. We often overgeneralize based on limited experiences. A helpful technique is to ask yourself, “What’s the worst that could happen, and how likely is it?” Then, we can develop more balanced thoughts. For instance, if you think “I’ll embarrass myself,” you might reframe it as, “Even if I feel nervous, I can still participate and most people are focused on themselves.”  

**Diego:** That makes sense. I’ll try that next time I’m in a social situation.  

**[11:20]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Great. Let’s also talk about your academic pressure. You mentioned feeling like you’re not doing enough. What specific tasks or deadlines are causing you the most stress right now?  

**Diego:** The upcoming project presentation and the research paper I need to submit. I keep worrying that I haven’t done enough analysis or that my work isn’t good enough. I’ve been procrastinating on some parts because I’m afraid of making mistakes.  

**Dr. Harper:** Procrastination often ties into fear of failure or perfectionism. When you think about your work, are there certain standards you’re holding yourself to that might be a bit unrealistic?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I tend to want everything to be perfect, especially in my research. I think if it’s not flawless, it’s not good enough. But I know that’s not practical.  

**Dr. Harper:** That’s a common challenge. We can work on setting more realistic goals and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This can help reduce the anxiety around perfectionism and make progress feel more achievable. Would you like to try creating a step-by-step plan for your project today?  

**Diego:** Yes, I think that would help. I often feel overwhelmed when I look at the whole task.  

**[11:25]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Perfect. Let’s start by listing all the components of your project. Then, we can prioritize and assign small, specific tasks to each step. How does that sound?  

**Diego:** Sounds good. I’ll get my notes and outline right now.  

**(Diego pulls up his notes and begins listing tasks.)**  

**[11:30]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Excellent. While you do that, I want to check in on your sleep habits. You mentioned last time that sleep quality impacted your overall mood and focus. How has that been going?  

**Diego:** Pretty consistent, actually. I’ve been sticking to the sleep hygiene tips we discussed, like avoiding screens before bed and keeping a regular schedule. I think it’s helped because I feel a bit more rested.  

**Dr. Harper:** That’s wonderful progress, Diego. Sleep plays a big role in managing anxiety and cognitive functioning. Keep tracking your sleep patterns with your app, and we can review your metrics next session to see if any adjustments are needed.  

**Diego:** Will do. I’ve also been trying to use the AI mood tracker you recommended, and it’s interesting to see patterns in my mood fluctuations.  

**Dr. Harper:** That’s great! Data can be very insightful. What have you noticed from tracking your mood?  

**Diego:** I noticed that my mood dips a lot after social interactions that I find stressful, and it tends to improve after practicing mindfulness or doing something relaxing.  

**Dr. Harper:** That’s valuable awareness. It shows you’re actively engaging in self-regulation strategies. As we continue, we can identify which techniques are most effective for you and tailor your approach.  

**[11:35]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Moving forward, let’s set some concrete goals for the next week. For example, practicing mindfulness daily, using cognitive restructuring in social situations, and completing the initial steps of your project outline. How does that sound?  

**Diego:** That sounds manageable. I’ll also try to limit my procrastination and be kinder to myself about progress.  

**Dr. Harper:** Excellent. Remember, progress isn’t always linear, and self-compassion is key. We’ll review your experience next week and adjust as needed.  

**[11:40]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Before we finish today, is there anything else on your mind or any particular area you want to focus on next time?  

**Diego:** I’d like to work more on social confidence, maybe with some exposure exercises, and also get some tips on managing my academic anxiety better.  

**Dr. Harper:** Those are great goals. We can incorporate some gradual exposure techniques and cognitive strategies to help with that. I'll prepare some exercises for our next session.  

**[11:45]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Well, Diego, I’m proud of the work you’ve done today. Keep up with your routines, and remember to be patient with yourself. I'll see you next week, same time.  

**Diego:** Thank you, Dr. Torres. I appreciate your support.  

**Dr. Harper:** You’re very welcome. Have a good week, and take care.  

**Diego:** You too. Bye!
