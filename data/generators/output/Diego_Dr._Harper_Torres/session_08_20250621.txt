Session 8/24
Date: June 21, 2025
Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. I’ve been okay, I guess. It’s been a busy week with finals coming up, and I’ve been feeling a little overwhelmed at times.

[11:03] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable, especially with exams on the horizon. Did you get a chance to try out any of the stress reduction exercises we discussed last time?

[11:05] Diego: Yeah, I practiced the breathing techniques a few mornings. It helps a little, especially before studying. But I still find my mind racing when I sit down to review my notes.

[11:07] Dr. Harper: That’s a common experience. Sometimes, the racing thoughts are linked to the pressure you’re feeling about performing well. Have you noticed any specific triggers during your study sessions?

[11:09] Diego: Mostly when I think about how much I still need to cover or if I worry about not understanding something quickly enough. It makes me anxious and less efficient.

[11:11] Dr. Harper: That makes sense. We know from previous sessions that perfectionism can heighten these worries. How about your sleep? Did you manage to stick with your sleep hygiene routine?

[11:13] Diego: I think so. It’s been a bit inconsistent, but I’ve tried to avoid screens an hour before bed and stick to a schedule. Still, some nights I wake up feeling restless.

[11:15] Dr. Harper: Restless nights can definitely affect your focus and mood. Remember, sleep hygiene is a process. We might look at some additional relaxation techniques or adjustments if needed. How are you feeling about your social interactions lately?

[11:17] Diego: Honestly, a bit more nervous. I’ve been trying to join some study groups, but I still feel pretty shy around new people. Sometimes, I worry about saying the wrong thing or coming off awkward.

[11:19] Dr. Harper: That’s very common, especially when you're stepping into new environments. Last time, we talked about exposure exercises—would you feel comfortable sharing how that’s been going?

[11:21] Diego: I tried to initiate a couple of conversations in the lounge or during group work, but I still get really anxious beforehand. My heartbeat speeds up and I worry I’ll embarrass myself.

[11:23] Dr. Harper: Those physical sensations are typical anxiety responses. When you notice your heart racing, can you practice a grounding technique, like focusing on your breath or the sensations around you?

[11:25] Diego: Yeah, I’ve tried that. It helps a little, but I still get stuck in my head about what to say next or whether I’m saying enough.

[11:27] Dr. Harper: That’s a good start. Cognitive restructuring can also help—challenging those negative thoughts about social failure. For example, if you think, “I’ll embarrass myself,” you can reframe it as, “Even if I stumble, it’s okay. Everyone makes mistakes, and most people are understanding.”

[11:29] Diego: That makes sense. I’ll try that next time. It’s just tough to believe it sometimes when the anxiety hits hard.

[11:31] Dr. Harper: Absolutely. It takes practice. Remember, exposure and restructuring are gradual processes. Over time, your confidence can grow. How about your academic goals? Are you feeling clearer about your research and future steps?

[11:33] Diego: A bit. I’ve been working on automating some parts of my research, which is satisfying. But I’m still unsure about what specialization I want to pursue after my master’s, and that’s stressing me out.

[11:35] Dr. Harper: It’s normal to feel uncertain at this stage. Let’s try a goal-setting exercise now. What are three specific steps you could take over the next month to explore potential specializations?

[11:37] Diego: Hmm. Maybe I can talk to some professors about their fields, read a few papers in different areas, and attend a couple of webinars or workshops.

[11:39] Dr. Harper: Those sound like excellent, actionable steps. How confident do you feel about following through with these?

[11:41] Diego: I think I can do it. I just need to organize my time better so I don’t get overwhelmed.

[11:43] Dr. Harper: Great. Let’s also consider some strategies to manage your workload, like prioritizing tasks and setting specific study blocks. How does that sound?

[11:45] Diego: That sounds helpful. Sometimes I get caught up trying to do everything at once, and then I burn out.

[11:47] Dr. Harper: That’s a common challenge. Using tools like a schedule or a task list can help you stay focused and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Also, remember to schedule some breaks and leisure time.

[11:49] Diego: Will do. I think I need to remind myself that progress is gradual, and that’s okay.

[11:51] Dr. Harper: Exactly. Growth isn’t linear. Recognizing your efforts, even small ones, is important. Before we finish today, let’s set a small homework assignment: practice your grounding techniques during social interactions, challenge negative thoughts as they come up, and start your exploration plan for research specialization.

[11:53] Diego: That sounds good. I’ll try to implement those this week.

[11:55] Dr. Harper: Excellent. And we’ll review your progress next session. Remember, it’s about consistent effort. How are you feeling about today’s session overall?

[11:57] Diego: Better, actually. It helps to talk through these things and get some concrete ideas. Thanks, Dr. Torres.

[11:59] Dr. Harper: You’re very welcome, Diego. I’m proud of your commitment. See you next week, and take care until then.
