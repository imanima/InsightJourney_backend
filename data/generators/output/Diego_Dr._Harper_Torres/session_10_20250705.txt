[11:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or notable over the past week?

[11:05] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been feeling more stressed with the upcoming research deadlines, but I also tried some of the breathing exercises you suggested, and they helped a bit.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: That’s good to hear. Breathing exercises can be quite effective for managing immediate stress. Can you tell me more about how you used them? Were you able to integrate them into your study routine?

[11:12] Diego: Yeah, I’ve been doing them right before study sessions. Like, I take a few deep breaths for about a minute, and it helps me feel more focused. But sometimes I forget when I get really anxious.

[11:15] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Remember, it’s normal to forget at times, especially under pressure. Maybe we can work on building a quick routine or cue that reminds you to do the breathing. For example, before opening your research papers or starting a coding session.

[11:20] Diego: That makes sense. I could set a timer or a reminder on my phone. Sometimes I also get anxious about social stuff, like talking to classmates or professors. I still feel pretty shy in new environments.

[11:25] Dr. Torres: Social anxiety is common, especially in new settings. You mentioned before that you want to build confidence in those situations. Have you tried any small exposure practices recently, like initiating brief conversations or attending social events?

[11:28] Diego: Not really. I’ve mostly avoided social situations because I worry I’ll say the wrong thing or seem awkward. It’s easier to just stay quiet.

[11:32] Dr. Torres: That avoidance can reinforce the anxiety over time. Would you be open to setting a small, manageable goal for this week? Maybe starting with saying hello to one new person or asking a classmate a quick question.

[11:35] Diego: Yeah, I think I can do that. Just a small step. It’s still intimidating, but I see how it could help.

[11:38] Dr. Torres: Absolutely. Progress is often about those small, consistent steps. Now, regarding your academic pressure—how are you managing the workload? Are there particular tasks that feel especially overwhelming?

[11:40] Diego: The research paper deadlines are the worst. I keep procrastinating because I get bogged down trying to perfect everything. It’s like I can’t move forward unless everything’s perfect.

[11:45] Dr. Torres: That perfectionism can really hinder progress. Remember, in our previous sessions, we discussed the idea of ‘good enough’ and setting realistic standards. How has that been going? Have you tried to implement those strategies?

[11:48] Diego: I’ve been trying, but it’s still hard. I catch myself editing the same paragraph for hours, worrying it’s not perfect enough. It’s frustrating.

[11:52] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. Cognitive restructuring can help here—reminding yourself that your work can be effective even if it isn’t flawless. Would you like to practice reframing that thought now?

[11:55] Diego: Sure, I can try.

[11:58] Dr. Torres: Okay. What’s the thought you’re having right now?

[12:00] Diego: I’m thinking, “If I don’t make this perfect, I’ll fail.”

[12:02] Dr. Torres: And how might we reframe that?

[12:05] Diego: Maybe… “Doing my best is enough. Perfection isn’t necessary for success.”

[12:07] Dr. Torres: Exactly. That’s a healthy, balanced perspective. Repeating that can help reduce your anxiety around deadlines. Now, looking ahead, what are some specific goals you want to focus on over the next month?

[12:10] Diego: I want to get better at time management, especially breaking down big tasks into smaller steps, and also practice more social interactions, even if they’re just small.

[12:15] Dr. Torres: Those are excellent goals. To support your time management, I suggest creating a weekly schedule with specific, manageable tasks. For social, maybe set a goal to initiate one new interaction per week, as we discussed.

[12:17] Diego: That sounds doable. I’ll try to plan that out today.

[12:20] Dr. Torres: Great. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling about the progress you’ve made so far? Any particular areas you feel more confident about?

[12:23] Diego: I think I’m starting to see how small changes add up. The breathing exercises help, and I’m trying not to be so hard on myself about perfectionism. It’s still tough, but I see some progress.

[12:27] Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, change takes time, and every step counts. For next week, I’d like you to practice your social goal and implement the time management plan. Also, keep using your breathing exercises as needed.

[12:30] Diego: Will do. Thanks, Dr. Torres. This session helped a lot.

[12:32] Dr. Torres: I’m glad to hear that. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a great day, Diego.

[12:34] Diego: Thanks, you too. Bye!

[12:35] Dr. Torres: Goodbye!
