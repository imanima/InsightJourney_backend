Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Diego, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or noteworthy you'd like to start with?

[11:05] Diego: Hey, thanks. Um, I think overall I’ve been okay. Still pretty stressed about the upcoming project deadline, but I’ve been trying to manage it better. Sometimes I feel like I’m more anxious about my social stuff, honestly.

[11:07] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. You mentioned last time that social anxiety was affecting your ability to reach out or participate in group work. How have things been on that front?

[11:10] Diego: Actually, I did try to say hi to a couple of classmates last week during a study break. It was nerve-wracking, but I managed to do it without panicking, so I guess that’s progress?

[11:12] Dr. Torres: That’s excellent, Diego. Even small steps like that are significant. How did it feel afterward? Did you notice any particular thoughts or feelings?

[11:15] Diego: Yeah, I felt pretty anxious during, mainly worried I’d say something stupid or be judged. But afterward, I felt relieved and a bit proud of myself for pushing through.

[11:17] Dr. Torres: That’s a great example of exposure in action. It sounds like your anxiety was present, but you still managed to act despite it. Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts when these situations come up?

[11:20] Diego: I guess I tend to think, “They’re probably judging me,” or “I’ll embarrass myself,” stuff like that. I know intellectually that it’s not always true, but the feelings are strong.

[11:22] Dr. Torres: That’s very common with social anxiety. Recognizing those automatic thoughts is a key step. Would you like to try a quick cognitive restructuring exercise now, to challenge some of those beliefs?

[11:25] Diego: Sure, I can try.

[11:26] Dr. Torres: Great. Think about a recent social interaction where you felt anxious. Can you briefly describe it?

[11:28] Diego: Last week, I tried to join a study group, but I hesitated and ended up just watching from the side. I kept thinking I’d be seen as awkward or not smart enough.

[11:30] Dr. Torres: Okay. So, the automatic thought was “I’ll be seen as awkward or not smart enough.” Now, what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this thought?

[11:32] Diego: Well, I did hesitate at first, but I also managed to show up and listen. No one said anything negative. But I guess I’m worried that, if I try to join again, I’ll mess up or be judged.

[11:35] Dr. Torres: That’s a good reflection. It sounds like your evidence shows that you can show up despite your fears, and that you’re capable of participating. What might be a more balanced thought?

[11:37] Diego: Maybe… “I was nervous, but I still tried, and that’s okay. People generally aren’t judging as harshly as I think.”

[11:40] Dr. Torres: Exactly. Reframing your automatic thought like that can help reduce anxiety over time. It’s about catching those thoughts early and challenging them.

[11:42] Diego: Yeah, I see how that could help. I’ve been trying to do that, but sometimes I forget or get overwhelmed.

[11:45] Dr. Torres: That’s normal. It’s a skill that improves with practice. Now, shifting gears a bit—how are your study strategies going? Any improvements in how you’re managing your workload and stress related to your project?

[11:48] Diego: I’ve started using a structured schedule, breaking down tasks into smaller steps. It’s helped me feel a bit less overwhelmed. I also tried some quick mindfulness exercises before studying, which seemed to help me focus.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: That’s excellent. Combining structured planning with mindfulness can be very effective. Do you notice any difference in your stress levels when you do these exercises?

[11:52] Diego: Yeah, I think I’m less anxious and more able to concentrate. It’s not perfect, but it’s a start.

[11:55] Dr. Torres: That’s promising. Remember, consistency is key. Have you also been keeping up with your sleep hygiene practices we discussed?

[11:58] Diego: I’ve been trying. I still struggle with going to bed on time, especially when I get caught up in my research or coding projects. But I’ve been avoiding screens an hour before bed and trying to wind down more.

[12:00] Dr. Torres: Good efforts. Sleep can significantly impact your anxiety and focus. Maybe setting a specific bedtime and sticking to it could help reinforce that routine. Would you like to set a goal for that?

[12:03] Diego: Yeah, I think I can aim for going to bed by 11 pm every night this week.

[12:05] Dr. Torres: That’s a clear, achievable goal. Now, thinking ahead, what are your main priorities for the next month? Any particular areas you want to focus on?

[12:07] Diego: I want to get better at social interactions, maybe join a club or attend more events. Also, I’d like to feel more confident about my research progress. And sleep is still a work in progress.

[12:10] Dr. Torres: Those are solid goals. How about we break them down into smaller, weekly steps? For example, attending at least one social event each week or practicing the cognitive restructuring exercise whenever you feel anxious.

[12:12] Diego: That makes sense. I’ll try to do that.

[12:15] Dr. Torres: Great. To summarize, this week you’ll focus on maintaining your sleep routine, practicing cognitive restructuring, and engaging in at least one social activity. Does that sound doable?

[12:17] Diego: Yes, I think so. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel like I’m making some progress, even if it’s slow.

[12:20] Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful to hear, Diego. Remember, progress isn’t always linear, and small steps add up. Next session, we can review how these goals went and adjust as needed. Any questions before we wrap up?

[12:22] Diego: Not right now, but I’ll definitely think about all this. Thanks for your help.

[12:25] Dr. Torres: You’re very welcome. Keep practicing your skills, and I look forward to hearing about your successes next week. Have a great day, Diego.

[12:26] Diego: Thanks, you too.
