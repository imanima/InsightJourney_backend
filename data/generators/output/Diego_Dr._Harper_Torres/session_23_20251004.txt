Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been this week? Any notable changes or experiences since our last session?

[11:05] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. I think overall, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been feeling more anxious about my research deadlines, but I also tried some of the breathing exercises you recommended, and that helped a little.

[11:07] Dr. Torres: That’s great to hear that the breathing exercises provided some relief. When you say you felt more anxious about deadlines, can you tell me more about what that looked like for you? Were there specific thoughts or physical sensations?

[11:10] Diego: Yeah, I’d start thinking, “I’m behind,” or “I won’t finish on time,” and my chest would feel tight, and my stomach kind of clenched. It’s like this constant nagging worry.

[11:12] Dr. Torres: Those are very common patterns, especially under academic pressure. It sounds like your mind is focusing on the worst-case scenarios, which can escalate anxiety. Remember, we talked about cognitive restructuring—would you like to try identifying and challenging some of these thoughts now?

[11:15] Diego: Yeah, I think I could use that. Sometimes I catch myself thinking I’ll fail everything, but I know that’s not entirely true.

[11:17] Dr. Torres: Good insight. Let’s take “I’ll fail everything.” What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this thought?

[11:20] Diego: Well, I’ve done well on past projects, and I’ve managed deadlines before, but I guess right now, the workload feels overwhelming, so it’s hard to see that.

[11:22] Dr. Torres: That’s a very balanced view. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed when things pile up, but it doesn’t mean you’ll fail. How about replacing that thought with something more balanced, like “I’ve managed challenges before, and I can focus on one step at a time”?

[11:25] Diego: Yeah, that sounds more realistic. I’ll try to remind myself of that.

[11:27] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Now, earlier you mentioned feeling homesick and social anxiety. How are those feelings affecting your daily interactions or study routines?

[11:30] Diego: I tend to avoid social situations, especially in group work. I get nervous about speaking up or making mistakes, so I just stay quiet most of the time. It’s like this cycle—I avoid, then feel more isolated.

[11:33] Dr. Torres: That avoidance can reinforce feelings of social anxiety and loneliness. We’ve talked before about gradual exposure—would you feel comfortable drafting a small plan to practice social interactions, maybe starting with low-stakes situations?

[11:36] Diego: I think I could try saying a quick hello to a classmate or participating a bit more in discussions, even if it’s just a little.

[11:39] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Remember, each small step builds confidence. How about setting a specific goal for next week? For example, saying one thing in class or joining a study group?

[11:42] Diego: Yes, I can do that. I’ll aim to speak up at least once in class or join a study chat.

[11:44] Dr. Torres: Perfect. Now, shifting gears a bit—how are your sleep habits? Last time, we discussed sleep hygiene routines.

[11:47] Diego: I’ve been trying to stick to a consistent schedule, but with all the stress, I still wake up sometimes during the night or have trouble falling asleep.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Stress can interfere with sleep quality. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed, like progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation?

[11:53] Diego: I tried a short meditation, but I find my mind keeps racing about work stuff.

[11:55] Dr. Torres: That’s common. Let’s practice a simple mindfulness exercise now—focusing on your breath, noticing sensations without judgment. Would you like to try that together for a couple of minutes?

[11:58] Diego: Sure, I can do that.

(They proceed with a brief guided mindfulness exercise.)

[12:03] Dr. Torres: How do you feel after that? Any shift in your tension or racing thoughts?

[12:05] Diego: A little calmer, actually. It’s hard to keep my mind from wandering, but I think I can incorporate this before bed.

[12:07] Dr. Torres: That’s a great plan. Consistent practice can improve sleep over time. As we wrap up today, let’s review some action steps. You’ll practice challenging negative thoughts about deadlines, aim to speak up once in class, and try a mindfulness exercise before sleep. Does that sound manageable?

[12:10] Diego: Yes, that feels doable. I appreciate the strategies, and I’ll work on implementing them.

[12:12] Dr. Torres: Excellent. For next week, I’d like you to keep a brief journal of your thoughts and feelings, especially around social situations and sleep. We’ll review your progress and adjust as needed. Any questions before we finish?

[12:15] Diego: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel more hopeful about tackling some of these challenges.

[12:17] Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Diego. Remember, change takes time, and small steps are progress. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care until then.
