Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or events this week?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Um, yeah, I think I’ve been okay. Things at school are still pretty stressful, but I’ve been trying to use some of the breathing exercises we practiced. I guess I feel a little more in control, but it’s still a lot.

[11:05] Dr. Torres: That’s good to hear you’re actively applying the breathing exercises. It’s a solid start. Can you tell me more about what you mean by feeling more in control? Are there specific situations where you notice a difference?

[11:07] Diego: Well, like during my study sessions, I used to get really overwhelmed when I think about the upcoming exams or deadlines. But last week, I tried to pause and do some deep breaths, and it helped me calm down enough to focus for a bit longer. Still not perfect, but better.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: That’s a great example of using a coping skill proactively. It sounds like you’re starting to build some awareness of your stress triggers and responses. Have you noticed any particular times or places where your anxiety tends to spike more?

[11:12] Diego: Mostly when I’m in the library, trying to study with a lot of people around. I start thinking I’m not going to finish everything on time or that I’ll mess up my research project. It makes me want to avoid those situations sometimes.

[11:15] Dr. Torres: Social anxiety in busy environments, I see. That’s quite common, especially when there's academic pressure. Have you tried any exposure techniques for those situations, or is that something you’re interested in working on?

[11:17] Diego: I’ve thought about it, but honestly, it feels pretty intimidating. I don’t want to embarrass myself or make things worse.

[11:20] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. We can approach this gradually, maybe starting with small social exposures outside the library or practicing social interactions in a safe setting. Remember, the goal is to build confidence bit by bit. Would you like to set a specific plan for that today?

[11:22] Diego: Yeah, I think that would help. Maybe I could try saying hi to a classmate I see around or join a study group online first?

[11:25] Dr. Torres: Those are excellent starting points. Small steps like saying hi or participating in virtual groups can lessen the pressure. How confident do you feel about initiating those kinds of interactions?

[11:27] Diego: Honestly, not very confident. But I want to get better at it. I just don’t know how to start sometimes.

[11:30] Dr. Torres: That’s where role-playing or scripting can help. We can practice some simple phrases now if you’re comfortable. For example, “Hi, I’m Diego. Are you working on the same project?” How does that sound?

[11:32] Diego: Yeah, I can try that. It feels a bit awkward, but I guess it’s better than just freezing.

[11:35] Dr. Torres: Exactly. It’s about reducing ambiguity and giving yourself a clear starting point. Would you like to try a quick role-play now?

[11:37] Diego: Sure, let’s do it.

(They proceed with a brief role-play, practicing initiating conversations)

[11:45] Dr. Torres: Great job, Diego. Remember, every small step counts, and it’s normal to feel awkward at first. Over time, these interactions will become more natural.

[11:48] Diego: Thanks. I think I can try to do that this week. It feels a bit less scary now.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful progress. Now, shifting gears a little, how have your sleep habits been? Last time, we discussed sleep hygiene strategies.

[11:52] Diego: I’ve been trying to stick to a schedule, but honestly, I still stay up late working on my research or coding projects. Sometimes I get so into it that I lose track of time.

[11:55] Dr. Torres: That’s quite common among students. Sleep hygiene is about consistency, so setting a regular bedtime can help, even if it’s hard at first. Have you noticed any differences in your mood or alertness when you do stick to a sleep schedule?

[11:57] Diego: Yeah, I feel more alert during the day, and I don’t get as anxious about my workload. But it’s tough to resist the urge to keep working late.

[12:00] Dr. Torres: It’s understandable. Sometimes, we need to set boundaries around work to protect our sleep. Maybe we can develop a wind-down routine that signals your brain it’s time to relax. Would you like some ideas on that?

[12:03] Diego: Yes, please. I think that might help me disconnect from my screen before bed.

[12:05] Dr. Torres: Great. Techniques like turning off screens an hour before bed, gentle stretching, or listening to calming music can be effective. How does that sound?

[12:07] Diego: I can try that. I often stay on my laptop until I’m exhausted, so a routine could help me stop earlier.

[12:10] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Let’s also revisit your academic goals. Last time, you mentioned wanting to excel in your research and build social confidence. How are you feeling about your progress towards those goals?

[12:12] Diego: I think I’m making some progress. I’ve started automating some parts of my research with scripts, which makes me feel more efficient. But I still feel anxious about presenting my findings or asking for feedback.

[12:15] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. Building confidence in presentation skills takes practice. Have you considered rehearsing your presentations or seeking feedback from a trusted peer?

[12:17] Diego: Not yet, but I could try practicing in front of my roommate or a friend online. That might help.

[12:20] Dr. Torres: That’s a good plan. Remember, exposure and rehearsal can reduce anxiety over time. Also, framing feedback as a tool for growth can make it feel less threatening.

[12:22] Diego: Yeah, I’ll try that. It’s reassuring to know that progress takes time and small steps.

[12:25] Dr. Torres: Absolutely. Consistency and patience are key. Before we wrap up, are there any other concerns or areas you’d like to focus on next time?

[12:27] Diego: Maybe I’d like to work more on managing my perfectionism—like, letting go of the need to be perfect all the time.

[12:30] Dr. Torres: That’s a valuable area. We can explore cognitive strategies to challenge perfectionist thoughts and develop self-compassion. For now, I’ll assign you some reflection exercises on that topic.

[12:32] Diego: Sounds good. I’ll think about it.

[12:34] Dr. Torres: Excellent. To summarize, this week, your action steps are: try initiating a small social interaction, implement your sleep routine, and practice rehearsing your research presentations. How does that feel?

[12:36] Diego: It feels manageable. Thanks, Dr. Torres.

[12:38] Dr. Torres: You’re doing great, Diego. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a good day!

[12:40] Diego: Thanks, you too.
