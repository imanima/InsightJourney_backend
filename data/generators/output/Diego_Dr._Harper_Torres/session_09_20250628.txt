**Dr. Torres:** Hi Diego, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or notable this week?  

**Diego:** Hi, Dr. Torres. Yeah, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I think I’ve been managing some of the stress better, but I still feel pretty overwhelmed with the research project and the social stuff.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s understandable, especially with all the demands you’re juggling. Last time, we talked about some stress reduction techniques and setting small social goals. Have you had a chance to practice any of those?  

**Diego:** I tried a couple of mindfulness exercises before studying, and I think they helped a little. Also, I went to a small meetup last weekend. It was nerve-wracking, but I stayed longer than I thought I would.  

**[11:10]**  
**Dr. Torres:** That’s a great step, Diego. Building social confidence takes time, and celebrating those small wins is important. What did you notice about your feelings during the meetup?  

**Diego:** I was pretty anxious at first—my heart was pounding, and I kept worrying about saying something dumb. But I focused on just listening, and once I started talking, I felt a bit more relaxed.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a classic pattern—initial anxiety, then gradual relaxation once you engage. How does that compare to your previous experiences? Has it shifted your perspective at all?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I guess I see that I can handle the discomfort. It’s still hard, but I’m starting to think maybe I don’t need to avoid it completely.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a significant insight. It’s about gradual exposure and learning that discomfort isn’t necessarily dangerous. How about your research project—any progress or challenges there?  

**[11:20]**  
**Diego:** Well, I managed to automate part of my data cleaning process using a new script I wrote. It saved me hours, which was awesome. But I’m still stuck on some statistical analysis, and the pressure is building up.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s fantastic progress on automation—that’s exactly the kind of efficiency boost you were aiming for. When you hit those sticking points in analysis, how do you usually respond?  

**Diego:** I tend to get frustrated and start doubting my abilities, like maybe I’m not cut out for this. Sometimes I just want to give up for a bit.  

**Dr. Torres:** Those feelings are common, especially under pressure. Remember, setbacks are part of the learning process. When you notice yourself spiraling into self-doubt, what might be a helpful way to reframe those thoughts?  

**Diego:** Maybe reminding myself that it’s okay to not know everything right away—that I can ask for help or take a break.  

**Dr. Torres:** Exactly. Cognitive restructuring can help you see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than failures. Speaking of which, have you been using any of the thought-recording tools we discussed?  

**[11:30]**  
**Diego:** Yeah, I’ve started journaling some of my negative thoughts after study sessions. It helps me see patterns, like thinking I’m not smart enough if I don’t understand something immediately.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a great start. Recognizing those automatic thoughts is key. Have you noticed any specific triggers that make your anxiety worse?  

**Diego:** Mostly when I compare myself to classmates or when I think about the future—like, am I going to be good enough for industry?  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a common concern. It’s helpful to remember that everyone’s journey is different, and your skills are valuable. Now, thinking about your goals—what’s one thing you want to focus on before our next session?  

**Diego:** I want to practice more social exposure, maybe attend another meetup, and also try to set a more structured schedule for my study time to reduce last-minute stress.  

**Dr. Torres:** Those sound like solid goals. How will you measure your progress?  

**Diego:** I could keep a journal of my social interactions and note how I feel afterward, plus track my study hours and feelings of control.  

**[11:40]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Excellent. Consistent tracking can give you concrete evidence of your growth. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Do you feel ready to try these steps this week?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I think I can do that. I also want to work on being kinder to myself when I mess up—like, not beating myself up over falling back into old habits.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a powerful mindset shift. Self-compassion is key to sustainable change. Let’s plan to review your progress in our next session. Any questions or concerns before we wrap up today?  

**Diego:** No, I think that covers everything. Thanks, Dr. Torres. It feels good to have a plan.  

**Dr. Torres:** I’m glad to hear that. You’re making meaningful progress, Diego. Keep up the great work, and I’ll see you next week.  

**Diego:** Thanks. See you then.
