[11:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or notable you'd like to start with?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Um, I think I've been okay, but honestly, the stress from finals and the upcoming projects is kind of piling up. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed, especially trying to balance everything.

[11:04] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, especially as the semester wraps up. You mentioned last time that you wanted to improve your study efficiency and manage anxiety around deadlines. Have you noticed any particular patterns or triggers lately?

[11:07] Diego: Yeah. I think I tend to procrastinate when I feel anxious about not understanding something fully. Then, when the deadline gets closer, I panic and cram, which makes me more anxious and less effective.

[11:09] Dr. Torres: That sounds like a cycle many students experience. It’s good you’re aware of it. Have you tried any techniques we discussed, like breaking tasks into smaller steps or using timed study blocks?

[11:11] Diego: I’ve tried breaking down tasks, but I still find myself avoiding harder topics. I think my perfectionism kicks in—I get stuck thinking I need to understand everything perfectly before I move on.

[11:13] Dr. Torres: That’s an important insight. Perfectionism can often lead to procrastination or paralysis. Would you be open to exploring some cognitive restructuring around these thoughts? For example, challenging the belief that you need to understand everything perfectly before progressing.

[11:15] Diego: Yeah, I think that could help. Sometimes I tell myself, “If I don’t get this right now, I’ll fail,” which isn’t true, but I get caught up in that.

[11:17] Dr. Torres: Exactly. That’s a common cognitive distortion—catastrophizing or all-or-nothing thinking. Let’s try a quick exercise. When that thought appears—“If I don’t understand this fully, I’ll fail”—what’s a more balanced way to look at it?

[11:20] Diego: Maybe… “It’s okay not to understand everything immediately. I can learn gradually and improve over time.”

[11:22] Dr. Torres: Great. Remember to practice catching those thoughts and challenging them. We can also incorporate some mindfulness exercises to help you stay present and reduce anxiety during study sessions. Would that be helpful?

[11:24] Diego: Yeah, I think that could help me stay calmer when I start feeling overwhelmed.

[11:26] Dr. Torres: Good. Now, I’d like to check in on your social confidence. Last time, you mentioned feeling shy around new classmates and colleagues. Have you had any opportunities or attempts at social exposure since then?

[11:28] Diego: I tried to say hi to a few classmates at the library, but I still felt pretty awkward. I’m worried I come off as distant or uninterested, even though I want to connect.

[11:30] Dr. Torres: That’s a common worry, especially if social anxiety is part of what you’re experiencing. Small steps are key. Maybe setting a goal to initiate a brief chat, like asking about their research or classes, could be a manageable exposure.

[11:32] Diego: I could try that. I guess I’m afraid they’ll think I’m weird or not want to talk.

[11:34] Dr. Torres: Those are common fears. Remember, most people are receptive if you approach with genuine curiosity. Reframing your thoughts—like “Most people are open to friendly conversations”—can reduce that anxiety. Would you like to practice a simple social exposure plan now?

[11:36] Diego: Sure, I can try. Maybe I’ll say hi to someone later today.

[11:38] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Keep track of how it goes, and we can review it next week. Now, shifting gears—how are you feeling about your future plans? Are you feeling clearer about your career path?

[11:40] Diego: Honestly, a bit more. I’ve been researching industry roles and talking to some alumni. I’m leaning toward data consulting or analytics, but I’m still unsure about the skills I need most.

[11:43] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Setting specific goals, like identifying key skills or certifications, can help clarify your path. Would you like to develop an action plan for skill-building or networking over the coming weeks?

[11:45] Diego: Yeah, I think that would be helpful. Maybe I can make a list of skills I need, then find online courses or workshops.

[11:47] Dr. Torres: Perfect. Also, consider scheduling informational interviews with professionals in those fields. That can give you firsthand insights and boost your confidence. How does that sound?

[11:49] Diego: That sounds good. I’ll look into it.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: Great. To wrap up today, I’d like you to practice the cognitive restructuring we discussed, use mindfulness exercises during study sessions, and aim for one social exposure before our next meeting. Does that sound manageable?

[11:52] Diego: Yes, I think I can do that. Thanks, Dr. Torres.

[11:54] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Keep track of your progress, and we’ll review it next week. Remember, small steps lead to sustained change. Take care, Diego.

[11:56] Diego: Thanks. See you next week.
