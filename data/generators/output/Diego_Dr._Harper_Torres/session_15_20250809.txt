**[11:00]**   
**Dr. Torres:** Hi Diego, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or notable you'd like to start with?  

**Diego:** Hey, yeah, I’ve been okay, I guess. Tried to keep up with the study schedule we planned. Still feeling pretty anxious about the upcoming project deadline, though. (pauses, looks slightly worried)  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s understandable. Deadlines can really ramp up the pressure, especially when you’re balancing so many things. Do you notice any particular thoughts or worries that come up when you think about the deadline?  

**Diego:** Yeah, mostly that I won’t finish in time, or that I’ll produce something subpar. I keep thinking I should have started earlier, but I kept putting it off. (fidgets with his hands)  

**[11:10]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Those are common thoughts, especially for someone with your perfectionist streak. Let’s try to break that down a bit. When you think “I won’t finish,” what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that?  

**Diego:** Well, I have been making steady progress, but it’s slower than I hoped. I’ve also missed a few small deadlines earlier this semester. So, part of me feels like I’m behind.  

**Dr. Torres:** It sounds like your mind is focusing on the gaps rather than the progress you’ve made. That’s a typical cognitive distortion—discounting positives. Can you think of recent examples where you completed tasks on time or even ahead of schedule?  

**Diego:** Hmm, actually, yes. Last week, I finished my data cleaning project a day early. And I got positive feedback from my advisor.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s great! Recognizing your successes helps balance that inner critic. How does it feel to acknowledge that?  

**Diego:** It feels a little strange, honestly. Like I’m not used to giving myself credit.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s common when perfectionism is involved. Let’s work on strengthening that positive self-talk. Moving forward, during your study sessions, try to note at least one thing you did well, no matter how small.  

**[11:20]**  
**Diego:** Okay, I can try that. It might help me see progress better. Also, I’ve been thinking about my social anxiety again. I’ve been avoiding social events on campus because I feel out of place.  

**Dr. Torres:** Social anxiety can be quite isolating. Have you noticed specific situations that trigger these feelings more strongly?  

**Diego:** Yeah, mainly when I have to speak up in class or approach new people. I worry I’ll say something stupid or look awkward.  

**Dr. Torres:** Those fears are very common. Remember, your thoughts about how you’re perceived are often exaggerated. Have you tried any small exposure exercises to gradually face these fears?  

**Diego:** Not really. I’ve thought about joining a club or study group, but I keep hesitating.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a good goal. Let’s plan a small step. Maybe you could start by saying hello to one new person on campus this week, or participating in an online discussion related to your research. How does that sound?  

**Diego:** I think I can do that. It’s manageable.  

**[11:30]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Great! Remember, exposure doesn’t have to be perfect; it’s about building confidence over time. Also, I’d like us to revisit some mindfulness exercises we discussed last time. Have you been practicing them?  

**Diego:** A little, yeah. I’ve been doing the breathing exercises before exams, and it helps a bit.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s excellent. Consistent practice can really make a difference. Today, I want us to try a brief mindfulness activity together—focusing on your breath for a few minutes—so you can experience it again. Would you like to try now?  

**Diego:** Sure, I can do that.  

**[11:40]**  
**(Guided mindfulness exercise, involving deep breathing and body scan)**  

**Dr. Torres:** How do you feel after that?  

**Diego:** More relaxed, I think. It’s surprising how just a few minutes can help clear my mind.  

**Dr. Torres:** Absolutely. Incorporating this into your daily routine, especially during stressful moments, can be very effective. Now, thinking about your broader goals—building social confidence, excelling academically, preparing for your transition into industry—how do you feel about your progress in these areas?  

**Diego:** I think I’ve made some progress, especially with managing my anxiety. I’m more aware of my negative thoughts, and I’ve started to challenge them. But I still feel unsure about how ready I am to enter the industry.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a common concern. Transitioning from academia to industry is a big step. Let’s break it down into smaller, manageable goals. For example, updating your resume, reaching out to professionals, practicing interview questions. Do you have a plan for that?  

**Diego:** I’ve started updating my resume, but I haven't reached out to anyone yet. I keep overthinking what to say.  

**Dr. Torres:** A good approach is to draft a basic message or email, then review and refine it. We can even do a role-play next session if you like. How does that sound?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I’d like that. It might help me feel more prepared.  

**[11:50]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Excellent. Before we wrap up today, I want to acknowledge your openness and the steps you’re taking. Remember, progress isn’t always linear. Keep practicing the mindfulness, challenge those negative thoughts, and take small social steps.  

**Diego:** Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel a bit more hopeful now.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s wonderful to hear. For our next session, I’d like you to try that social exposure step and keep a journal of your thoughts and feelings about it. Also, let’s review your resume draft. Does that work for you?  

**Diego:** Yes, that sounds good. Thanks again.  

**Dr. Torres:** You’re welcome, Diego. See you next week. Take care until then.
