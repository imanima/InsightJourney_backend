Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Diego: Hi Dr. Torres. Um, honestly, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been feeling more overwhelmed lately with the research deadlines, but I’ve also managed to get some good sleep the past few nights, so that’s a plus.

[11:05] Dr. Harper: That’s good to hear about the sleep. Sleep quality can really impact how we handle stress. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed—what’s been the biggest source of that lately?

[11:07] Diego: Mostly the deadlines. I’m trying to balance my coursework, my research assistantship, and, honestly, I feel like I’m falling behind in some areas. Plus, I still get anxious about social stuff, especially meeting new people here.

[11:10] Dr. Harper: That sounds like a lot to juggle. It's understandable to feel stressed with so many demands. Last time, we talked about some stress reduction exercises—have you been practicing any of those?

[11:12] Diego: A little. I’ve tried doing some breathing exercises before exams or meetings, but I haven’t been consistent with it.

[11:15] Dr. Harper: Consistency can make a big difference. Maybe we can set a small, daily routine for that—like a 2-minute breathing exercise every morning. Would that work for you?

[11:17] Diego: Yeah, I think I can do that. It’s just hard to remember sometimes.

[11:20] Dr. Harper: We can set a reminder on your phone or link it to something you already do daily. Also, I wanted to check in on your study strategies—how are your current methods working?

[11:22] Diego: Honestly, I think I could be more efficient. I tend to spend a lot of time re-reading everything, which isn’t great. I read somewhere that active recall and spaced repetition are better, but I haven’t really implemented them fully.

[11:25] Dr. Harper: That’s a good insight. Using active recall can help you retain information more effectively. Would you like to try integrating some quick self-quizzes into your study sessions next week?

[11:27] Diego: Yeah, I can try that. It might help me feel more confident about the material too.

[11:30] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Now, regarding your social anxiety—how have things been in social settings lately?

[11:32] Diego: Honestly, I’ve been avoiding a lot of social events. It’s easier to stay in my room and focus on work, but I know that’s not ideal.

[11:35] Dr. Harper: Avoidance can temporarily reduce discomfort, but it often reinforces the anxiety over time. Have you considered gradual exposure—like attending small gatherings or saying hello to classmates?

[11:37] Diego: I guess I could start small. There’s a study group I’ve been meaning to join but haven’t because of the anxiety.

[11:40] Dr. Harper: That sounds like a great step. Maybe you can set a goal to attend one session this week, even if just for a few minutes. How does that feel?

[11:42] Diego: It’s a bit scary, honestly, but I think I can do it.

[11:45] Dr. Harper: That’s a strong willingness. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous—part of the process is learning to sit with that discomfort. How about we plan to check in next week on how that went?

[11:47] Diego: Sounds good.

[11:50] Dr. Harper: Great. Now, thinking about your long-term goals—what steps are you taking toward preparing for the industry transition after your degree?

[11:52] Diego: I’ve been working on my portfolio and some projects, like developing a custom GPT model. I want to make sure I stand out when I apply for jobs, but I also feel a lot of pressure to be perfect.

[11:55] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable—ambition can be a double-edged sword. Remember, progress matters more than perfection. Have you set specific, manageable goals for your job prep?

[11:57] Diego: I suppose I could set weekly goals, like finishing a part of my portfolio or reaching out to a couple of industry contacts.

[12:00] Dr. Harper: That’s a solid plan. Breaking it into smaller steps can reduce anxiety and help you see steady progress. Now, reflecting on our work over the past sessions—what’s been most helpful so far?

[12:02] Diego: I think understanding my anxiety better and learning some practical tools like breathing exercises have helped. Also, just talking about my goals makes them feel more achievable.

[12:05] Dr. Harper: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, this is a process, and building confidence takes time. For next steps, I’d like you to try the daily breathing exercise, attend at least one social event, and set weekly career goals. How does that sound?

[12:07] Diego: That sounds doable. Thanks, Dr. Torres.

[12:10] Dr. Harper: Great. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Keep in mind, small steps lead to big changes. Take care until then.
