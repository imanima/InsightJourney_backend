Date: August 23, 2025
Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Um, I think overall, I’ve been okay. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything, but I’ve been trying to keep up with the techniques we discussed.

[11:05] Dr. Torres: That’s great to hear you’re actively applying what we’ve worked on. Last time, we talked about your stress levels during exams and project deadlines. Have you noticed any particular patterns or triggers lately?

[11:07] Diego: Yeah, actually. I’ve been getting more anxious when I think about the upcoming research presentation next week. I keep doubting my preparation, even though I’ve practiced a lot.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: That sounds challenging. It’s common to have those doubts, especially before important events. Remember, in our previous sessions, we worked on cognitive restructuring to challenge those negative thoughts. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up?

[11:12] Diego: Yeah, I keep thinking, “What if I mess up and everyone thinks I’m incompetent?” It’s like this constant loop.

[11:15] Dr. Torres: That’s a very common fear, especially among high-achievers like yourself. Let’s try to reframe that thought. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that worry?

[11:17] Diego: Well, I’ve prepared thoroughly, and I’ve received positive feedback from my advisor before. But I guess I’m afraid that it’s not enough and that I’ll stumble under pressure.

[11:20] Dr. Torres: That’s a good insight. So, the evidence suggests you are prepared and capable. Sometimes, our fears are amplified by perfectionism or fear of judgment. Have you noticed if those feelings come up often?

[11:22] Diego: Yeah, especially when I compare myself to others. I see classmates presenting confidently, and I feel like I’m behind or not good enough.

[11:25] Dr. Torres: That comparison can fuel anxiety. Remember, everyone has their own pace and strengths. For now, focusing on your progress and efforts can help reduce that pressure. Did you try any of the mindfulness exercises we discussed last week to ground yourself when these thoughts come up?

[11:27] Diego: I did a few breathing exercises before bed, and it helped a little, but I still feel the tension during the day.

[11:30] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Mindfulness takes practice, especially during stressful moments. Let’s try a quick grounding exercise now. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and focus on what you can see, hear, and feel around you. (pauses) How do you feel after that?

[11:33] Diego: A bit calmer, I think. It’s helpful to just pause and focus on the present.

[11:35] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Incorporating short grounding techniques during your day can help manage that anxiety. Now, I’d like to revisit your study routines. How are you doing with your time management and focus?

[11:37] Diego: Honestly, I’ve been trying to use a Pomodoro timer, but I get distracted easily, especially when I’m trying to analyze data or write code. I think I need to improve my environment or routines.

[11:40] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. Have you considered creating a dedicated, distraction-free workspace? Also, breaking your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can make them less overwhelming. Would you like us to develop a specific plan together?

[11:42] Diego: Yeah, that would be helpful. Maybe setting specific goals for each study session could work.

[11:45] Dr. Torres: Great idea. Let’s set a goal for your next week: aim to complete one section of your research paper and practice your presentation in a mock setting. How does that sound?

[11:47] Diego: That sounds doable. I’ll try to stick to that.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: Perfect. Now, shifting gears, how are you feeling about your social interactions lately? You mentioned feeling shy and anxious around new people.

[11:52] Diego: Yeah, I’ve been avoiding social events, even some study groups. I worry I’ll say the wrong thing or not be interesting enough.

[11:55] Dr. Torres: It’s understandable. Small steps can help build confidence. Have you tried any exposure exercises, like briefly chatting with classmates or attending low-pressure events?

[11:57] Diego: I’ve hesitated, but I did say a few words to a classmate yesterday—just a quick hello. It felt awkward, but I didn’t run away.

[12:00] Dr. Torres: That’s a positive step. Recognizing that discomfort and still engaging is progress. Over time, these small exposures can lessen your anxiety. Would you be willing to set a goal to initiate a brief conversation or attend one social event this week?

[12:02] Diego: Yeah, I think I can do that. Just a quick chat or joining a study group for a little while.

[12:05] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. And I’m here to support you through each step. Before we wrap up, do you want to review the action items?

[12:07] Diego: Sure. So, I’ll practice the grounding exercise during stressful moments, work on my study plan with specific goals, and try to initiate at least one social interaction this week.

[12:10] Dr. Torres: Exactly. And keep track of your feelings and any changes you notice—they’ll be helpful for our next session. How are you feeling about everything overall?

[12:12] Diego: A bit more hopeful, I guess. It’s reassuring to have concrete steps. Sometimes I get caught up in my worries, but talking about it helps me see things clearer.

[12:15] Dr. Torres: That’s a great realization. Remember, change takes time, and your efforts add up. I’ll see you next week, and we can review how these new strategies worked for you.

[12:17] Diego: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate your support.

[12:20] Dr. Torres: You’re very welcome. Take care, Diego. See you next week.
