[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Um, I think I’ve been okay, overall. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with school stuff and social things, but I’ve been trying to keep up with the exercises we discussed.

[11:04] Dr. Harper: That’s good to hear. Last time, we talked about some stress management techniques and setting small social goals. How has implementing those been going?

[11:07] Diego: Well, I did try to reach out to a couple of classmates for a study group. It was nerve-wracking, honestly. I sent a message in our class chat, but I haven’t heard back yet. I guess I’m still pretty anxious about putting myself out there.

[11:10] Dr. Harper: That’s a common experience, especially with social anxiety. Remember, exposure takes practice—and even just initiating the message is a step forward. How did you feel afterward?

[11:12] Diego: Honestly, kind of relieved, but also a bit disappointed that I haven’t received a reply. I keep thinking maybe I’m bothering them or that I’ll be rejected.

[11:15] Dr. Harper: Those thoughts are understandable. Let’s try to challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that you’re bothering them or that they’ll reject you?

[11:18] Diego: Well, I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. They might be busy or just didn’t see my message. I know I tend to assume the worst.

[11:20] Dr. Harper: Exactly. That’s a common cognitive distortion—catastrophizing or jumping to conclusions. Today, let’s work on identifying and reframing those thoughts. Do you recall the cognitive restructuring worksheet from last time?

[11:23] Diego: Yeah, I do. I think I can try that again. Maybe write down my thought, then look for evidence against it.

[11:25] Dr. Harper: Good. Let’s do a quick example now. What’s a recent thought you had that caused you anxiety?

[11:27] Diego: I was thinking, “If I don’t get into a good internship, I’ll never make it in tech. I’m falling behind.”

[11:29] Dr. Harper: That’s a strong thought. How would you evaluate it objectively?

[11:31] Diego: Well, I guess I’m comparing myself to others. I’ve only been here a few months, and I have time to find opportunities. Plus, I’ve already done some research automation projects that might stand out.

[11:34] Dr. Harper: Exactly. So, the thought might be an overgeneralization. A more balanced thought could be, “I’m still early in my program, and I’ve made progress. There are opportunities ahead.” How does that feel?

[11:37] Diego: It feels a bit more hopeful, but I still worry I won’t be competitive enough.

[11:39] Dr. Harper: That’s normal. Let’s add another layer—what small, actionable steps can you take toward your internship goal this week?

[11:42] Diego: I could look into applying to at least two internships and reach out to my advisor for feedback on my resume.

[11:44] Dr. Harper: Great. Taking concrete steps can reduce anxiety because it shifts focus from uncertainty to action. How about your sleep—have you been able to stick to the sleep hygiene practices we discussed?

[11:46] Diego: Mostly, yes. I’ve been trying to avoid screens an hour before bed and sticking to a consistent schedule. I still wake up a couple of times during the night, though.

[11:48] Dr. Harper: That’s progress. The nighttime awakenings can sometimes be linked to anxiety or racing thoughts. Have you tried any mindfulness exercises before bed?

[11:50] Diego: Not really, but I could try that. Maybe some deep breathing or a short body scan.

[11:52] Dr. Harper: That could be helpful. Let’s plan to incorporate a brief mindfulness practice into your bedtime routine this week. Now, how are you feeling about your social goals overall? Any new insights?

[11:55] Diego: I think I’m still nervous, but I’m starting to see that the worst-case scenarios I imagine aren’t always true. It’s just hard to get over that initial fear.

[11:57] Dr. Harper: That’s a significant realization. Anxiety often thrives on the fear of the unknown or “what if” scenarios. Remember, gradual exposure with a focus on acceptance can help reduce that fear over time. Would you be willing to try a simple social exposure this week, like saying hello to someone in class?

[12:00] Diego: Yeah, I can do that. Just a hello. That feels manageable.

[12:02] Dr. Harper: Perfect. Keep track of how it feels, and we’ll review it next session. As a next step, I’d like you to practice the cognitive restructuring with any anxious thoughts that come up and continue your sleep hygiene and social exposure tasks.

[12:04] Diego: Will do. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel like I’m making progress, even if it’s slow.

[12:06] Dr. Harper: That’s excellent. Progress is often gradual. Remember to be kind to yourself and recognize each small step. We’ll review how these strategies work for you next week. Any final questions or thoughts before we wrap up?

[12:08] Diego: No, I think I’m good for now. Thanks for the support.

[12:10] Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Diego. Keep up with the exercises, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Have a good week!

[12:12] Diego: Thanks, you too. Bye!

[12:14] Dr. Harper: Goodbye.
