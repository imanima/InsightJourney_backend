Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Diego, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Um, honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed, especially with finals coming up. But I guess that’s pretty normal.

[11:05] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Stress around finals can definitely pile up. Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns in how you're feeling during this time?

[11:07] Diego: Yeah, I think I start to get anxious when I think about all the work I still need to do, and I worry about not doing enough or messing up.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: It sounds like perfectionism and fear of not meeting your standards are playing a role. Last time, we discussed some stress management techniques and setting realistic goals. How have you been applying those since then?

[11:12] Diego: I tried to break down my study schedule into smaller tasks, and I’ve been using mindfulness exercises for a few minutes before I start studying. It helps a little.

[11:15] Dr. Torres: That’s great progress. Small steps like breaking tasks down can really reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. How did the mindfulness exercises work for you? Did you notice any difference in your focus or anxiety levels?

[11:17] Diego: Yeah, I think I felt a bit calmer before starting. It’s still hard to stay consistent, but I notice when I do them, I’m a bit more present and less anxious.

[11:20] Dr. Torres: That’s a valuable observation. Building consistency takes time, but every effort counts. Let’s explore how stress impacts your study efficiency—are there specific moments when your anxiety tends to spike more?

[11:22] Diego: Mostly when I hit a tough problem or when I look at my to-do list and realize I have so much left. Sometimes I freeze for a moment.

[11:25] Dr. Torres: That freeze response is quite common. It’s your mind’s way of signaling overwhelm. When that happens, what do you usually do?

[11:27] Diego: I tend to procrastinate or avoid for a bit, then I feel guilty about wasting time.

[11:30] Dr. Torres: Recognizing that pattern is an important step. We can work on some cognitive restructuring to challenge the thoughts that lead to procrastination, like “I have to do everything perfectly now” or “If I don’t finish this immediately, I’ll fail.” Would you be comfortable trying that today?

[11:32] Diego: Yeah, I think that could help. Sometimes I get stuck in that perfectionist loop.

[11:35] Dr. Torres: Great. Let's pick a recent example. Can you tell me about a moment where you felt overwhelmed and started to procrastinate?

[11:37] Diego: Sure. Yesterday, I was working on a data analysis report, and I kept doubting my approach. I thought, “If this isn’t perfect, it’s all useless,” and I ended up scrolling social media for a while instead of working.

[11:40] Dr. Torres: That’s a common thought pattern—perfectionism leading to avoidance. Let’s try rephrasing that thought. What could be a more balanced or realistic way to see this situation?

[11:42] Diego: Maybe… “This report is important, but I don’t need it to be perfect right now. Doing some work is better than none.”

[11:45] Dr. Torres: Exactly. That cognitive shift can reduce the pressure and make it easier to start. How did it feel to consider that alternative thought?

[11:47] Diego: It felt a little relieving, honestly. Like I don’t have to be perfect every time.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: That’s excellent. Remember, progress is about consistency, not perfection. Now, shifting gears a bit—how are you feeling about social interactions lately? Last time, we talked about building confidence in new environments.

[11:52] Diego: Honestly, I’ve been avoiding social stuff because I still feel pretty shy. But I did attend a small study group last week, and I managed to ask a few questions.

[11:55] Dr. Torres: That’s a wonderful step forward. Even small efforts like asking questions can help reduce social anxiety over time. How did it feel afterward?

[11:57] Diego: It was nerve-wracking, but I felt a bit more confident afterward. Like I took a small win.

[12:00] Dr. Torres: That’s a positive reinforcement loop. Building social confidence is often about accumulating these small wins. Are there specific situations where you’d like to practice more exposure?

[12:02] Diego: Maybe participating more in class discussions or reaching out to classmates for study help.

[12:05] Dr. Torres: Good targets. Remember, you can set small, achievable goals—like contributing one comment per class or sending a message to a classmate each week. Would you like to set a specific goal for this week?

[12:07] Diego: Yeah, I can try to ask at least one question during my next class.

[12:10] Dr. Torres: Perfect. Now, regarding your future plans, I know you're feeling some pressure about transitioning into industry. How are you feeling about that?

[12:12] Diego: Honestly, it’s scary. I’m worried I won’t find a job I like or that I’ll fall behind if I don’t get everything perfect.

[12:15] Dr. Torres: That’s a common concern among students. Let’s explore some realistic steps you can take to prepare, and how to manage the anxiety around the unknown.

[12:17] Diego: Maybe updating my resume, networking a bit, and doing some mock interviews?

[12:20] Dr. Torres: Those are excellent action items. Breaking it down makes it feel more manageable. Also, remember to acknowledge your efforts and progress—you’re already taking proactive steps.

[12:22] Diego: Yeah, I guess I forget to give myself credit sometimes.

[12:25] Dr. Torres: That’s very normal. Self-acknowledgment is key to maintaining motivation. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on your sleep—how has that been since we discussed sleep hygiene strategies?

[12:27] Diego: Better, I think. I’ve been sticking to a sleep schedule more consistently, and I avoid screens an hour before bed.

[12:30] Dr. Torres: That’s great progress. Sleep quality is crucial for managing stress and focus. Remember, if you notice any persistent sleep issues, we can explore further interventions.

[12:32] Diego: Thanks, I will. Overall, I think I’m making some good progress, even if it’s slow sometimes.

[12:35] Dr. Torres: Absolutely, Diego. Progress is often gradual, and you’re doing well. For next time, I’d like you to continue with your study goals, practice your social exposure, and keep track of any thoughts that come up around perfectionism or anxiety.

[12:37] Diego: Will do. Thanks, Dr. Torres.

[12:40] Dr. Torres: You’re welcome. Great work today. See you next week.

[12:42] Diego: See you then.
