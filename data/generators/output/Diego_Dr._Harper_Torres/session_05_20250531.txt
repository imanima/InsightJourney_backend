Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable moments or changes this week?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Um, I think I’ve been okay, mostly just trying to keep up with everything. The stress from exams and research is still pretty high, but I’ve been working on some of the breathing exercises we discussed.

[11:04] Dr. Harper: That’s great to hear you’re practicing breathing techniques. Can you tell me a bit about how they’ve been working for you? Any particular moments where you noticed a difference?

[11:06] Diego: Yeah, actually, yesterday I was feeling pretty overwhelmed right before a meeting with my advisor. I took a few deep breaths, and it helped me calm down enough to focus. I still felt anxious, but it was manageable.

[11:08] Dr. Harper: That’s a good example of effective use of the technique, Diego. It’s normal to still feel some anxiety, especially in high-pressure situations. The goal is to build that skill so it becomes more automatic over time. How does that fit with your overall stress levels during the week?

[11:10] Diego: Honestly, it’s a rollercoaster. Some days are better, especially when I get a good night’s sleep or finish a task. But other days, the pressure just builds up, especially with all the deadlines. I guess I still struggle with balancing everything.

[11:12] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. The workload and new environment can definitely feel overwhelming. You mentioned sleep—how have your sleep patterns been lately?

[11:14] Diego: Not great, honestly. I’ve been staying up late trying to finish coding projects or research, then waking up early to review things. I think I’m getting maybe 5 or 6 hours, but it’s not very restful.

[11:16] Dr. Harper: Sleep deprivation can definitely amplify stress and anxiety. Remember, sleep hygiene is a key part of managing these symptoms. Are you still using the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed, like avoiding screens before bed or maintaining a consistent schedule?

[11:18] Diego: I’ve tried, but I admit I sometimes break those rules, especially when I get into a flow state with my work. I find it hard to stop coding or designing at a set time.

[11:20] Dr. Harper: That’s a common challenge, especially for someone with your tech background. Let’s explore some ways to set boundaries around your work without feeling like you’re losing progress. We can look into scheduled “shutdown” routines or timers to help you transition to sleep.

[11:22] Diego: Yeah, I think that might help. Sometimes I just get so immersed that I forget about everything else.

[11:24] Dr. Harper: That immersion can be a sign of your passion, which is great, but it’s important to protect your rest. Moving forward, how comfortable are you with implementing a strict wind-down routine before bed?

[11:26] Diego: I’m willing to try. Maybe setting a specific time to stop working and doing some mindfulness exercises instead.

[11:28] Dr. Harper: That sounds like a solid plan. Incorporating mindfulness can also help reduce overall stress during the day. Have you noticed any patterns in your social interactions or feelings of homesickness that affect your mood?

[11:30] Diego: Yeah, I still feel pretty shy around new people, especially in group settings. I tend to stay quiet and worry about saying something wrong. Sometimes I miss home and the familiarity, which makes me more anxious.

[11:32] Dr. Harper: Social anxiety and homesickness are common, especially in a new environment. We’ve worked on exposure techniques before—have you been able to practice any small social exposures this week?

[11:34] Diego: A little. I joined a study group last week, and I tried to contribute when I could. It was nerve-wracking at first, but I think I did okay. Still, I felt pretty anxious afterward.

[11:36] Dr. Harper: That’s a significant step forward, Diego. It’s normal to feel anxious afterward—it shows you’re pushing your comfort zone. How did you feel about the experience overall?

[11:38] Diego: Honestly, I was proud of myself for trying. I still prefer to stay quiet, but I know I need to get more comfortable speaking up.

[11:40] Dr. Harper: That’s excellent progress. Small steps like participating in the study group build confidence over time. Let’s consider setting a goal to speak up at least once in your next group meeting. Would you feel comfortable with that?

[11:42] Diego: Yeah, I think I can do that. Just one comment or question would be a good start.

[11:44] Dr. Harper: Perfect. We’ll work on that next week. Now, regarding your academic goals—how are your research projects progressing? Any obstacles or successes?

[11:46] Diego: Actually, I made some good progress on my data analysis last week. I automated some parts using scripts I wrote, which saved me a lot of time. But I still feel cautious about whether I’m doing the best approach.

[11:48] Dr. Harper: That’s a smart move—using automation to streamline your work. It’s normal to feel cautious, especially when you’re pushing your skills. Are you experiencing any perfectionism tendencies that might be holding you back?

[11:50] Diego: Yeah, sometimes I get stuck trying to make everything perfect, and I end up overthinking or delaying my work.

[11:52] Dr. Harper: Perfectionism can be a barrier to progress. Remember, in research and in life, “done” is often better than “perfect.” We can work on cognitive restructuring around these thoughts—reminding yourself that mistakes are part of learning.

[11:54] Diego: That makes sense. I’ll try to keep that in mind, especially when I get caught up in details.

[11:56] Dr. Harper: Excellent. To wrap up, let’s set some action items. First, continue practicing your breathing and mindfulness exercises, especially before bed. Second, aim to speak up at least once in your next study group. And third, work on setting a consistent evening routine to improve your sleep hygiene. How does that sound?

[11:58] Diego: That sounds good. I’ll do my best to stick to those.

[12:00] Dr. Harper: Great. Next week, we’ll check in on your progress and address any new challenges. Remember, small steps lead to big change. Thanks for your openness today, Diego.

[12:02] Diego: Thank you, Dr. Torres. See you next week.
