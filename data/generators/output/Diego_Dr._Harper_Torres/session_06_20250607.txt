Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Diego (Data Science Master's Student)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Diego: Hi, Dr. Torres. Um, I think I’ve been okay. The week was a bit stressful, but I managed to get through some of my projects. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything, honestly.

[11:04] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, especially with your busy schedule. Last time, we talked about some stress management techniques, like deep breathing. Have you been able to practice those at all?

[11:06] Diego: Yeah, I’ve tried a couple of times before studying or before big deadlines, and it helps a little. Sometimes I forget, though, or I just get too anxious to remember to do it.

[11:08] Dr. Torres: That’s common. It takes practice to incorporate these techniques into your routine. Would you like to try a quick mindfulness exercise now? It could help anchor you for the session.

[11:09] Diego: Sure, I can try.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: Great. Let’s do a simple breathing exercise. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose for four seconds… hold it for two… and then exhale slowly through your mouth for six. Let’s do that a couple of times.

(They pause briefly as Diego follows the instructions)

[11:14] Dr. Torres: How do you feel now?

[11:15] Diego: A little calmer, I think. It’s nice to just focus on breathing for a moment.

[11:16] Dr. Torres: That’s excellent. Remember, even brief moments like that can help manage anxiety in real-time. So, last session, we also discussed your social anxiety and feeling out of place in your new environment. How’s that been going?

[11:18] Diego: Honestly, I’ve still been avoiding some social situations, especially in large groups. I did try to say hi to a couple of classmates, but I felt pretty awkward. It’s like I’m worried I’ll say something stupid or they won’t want to talk to me.

[11:20] Dr. Torres: That’s a very common experience, especially when stepping into new social settings. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up when you’re about to engage socially?

[11:22] Diego: Yeah, I keep thinking, “They’ll think I’m weird,” or “I don’t belong here.” It’s like a loop of negative thoughts I can’t break out of.

[11:24] Dr. Torres: That’s a pattern we’ve seen before. The good news is, we can work on challenging those thoughts. Remember how we talked about cognitive restructuring? Let’s try to reframe one of these thoughts now. Which one feels most relevant right now?

[11:26] Diego: Probably the “I don’t belong here” one.

[11:27] Dr. Torres: Okay. What evidence do you have that supports the idea you don’t belong?

[11:29] Diego: Well, I guess I feel a bit behind compared to others who seem more confident or outgoing.

[11:31] Dr. Torres: And what evidence might contradict that? Are there times when you’ve felt welcome or included?

[11:33] Diego: Yeah, actually, last week I sat in on a study group, and they seemed happy to have me join. I was nervous, but they were friendly.

[11:35] Dr. Torres: Exactly. So, the thought “I don’t belong” is based on some feelings of insecurity, but there’s also evidence that you do belong. How about reframing it as, “I am new, but I am capable of building connections here”?

[11:37] Diego: Yeah, I like that. It feels more realistic.

[11:39] Dr. Torres: Great. Practice catching these thoughts when they come up, and try replacing them with more balanced perspectives. Now, shifting gears a little, you mentioned wanting to improve your study efficiency. How’s that been going?

[11:41] Diego: I think I’ve been better at planning my study sessions. Last week, I used a Pomodoro timer, and it helped me focus more. I also created a schedule for my research tasks, so I don’t feel so overwhelmed.

[11:43] Dr. Torres: That’s excellent progress. Using structured techniques like Pomodoro can really boost productivity and reduce procrastination. How do you feel about your overall workload right now?

[11:45] Diego: It’s still a lot, but I’m starting to feel more in control. Sometimes I get anxious about deadlines, but having a plan makes it a bit easier.

[11:47] Dr. Torres: That’s a positive sign. Remember, managing your workload is not just about planning but also about recognizing when to take breaks and practice self-care. Speaking of which, have you been able to incorporate any sleep hygiene routines we discussed?

[11:49] Diego: I’ve tried to stick with a consistent sleep schedule, even if I stay up late sometimes. I’ve also avoided screens an hour before bed, which helps me fall asleep faster.

[11:51] Dr. Torres: That’s great. Sleep is fundamental for your mental clarity and stress management. How are you feeling physically and emotionally in terms of rest?

[11:53] Diego: Slightly better, I think. I still wake up a couple of times during the night, but overall, I feel more rested than before.

[11:55] Dr. Torres: That’s encouraging. Keep reinforcing those habits. Before we wrap up, I’d like to check in on your long-term goals. Last time, we discussed your desire to build social confidence, excel academically, and prepare for your future career. How do you feel about your progress toward these goals?

[11:57] Diego: I think I’m making small steps. The social part is still hard, but I’m trying to push myself a little more each week. With my studies, I’ve been more organized, and I’ve started looking into internships for next summer.

[11:59] Dr. Torres: That’s fantastic. Progress is often incremental, but it’s there. For next steps, I’d like you to continue practicing cognitive restructuring for your social thoughts, keep using your study routines, and maybe set a small goal for social exposure each week—like initiating a brief chat or attending a small group.

[12:01] Diego: Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try to push myself a bit more.

[12:03] Dr. Torres: Excellent. And as always, if you notice yourself feeling overly anxious or stuck, reach out. Next week, we’ll check on how those exposure steps go and explore any new challenges.

[12:05] Diego: Sounds good. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel like I’ve learned a lot today.

[12:07] Dr. Torres: I’m glad to hear that, Diego. Keep up the good work, and I’ll see you next week.
