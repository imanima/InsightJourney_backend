**[11:00]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Hi Diego, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**Diego:** Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more overwhelmed these past few days. The workload’s been intense, and I’ve been anxious about the upcoming research presentation.  

**Dr. Torres:** That sounds challenging. Let’s start there—what specific thoughts are coming up around the presentation?  

**Diego:** Well, I keep thinking I might mess up or that I’m not prepared enough, even though I’ve been practicing. It’s like this constant worry that I’ll fail publicly, which makes me more anxious.  

**[11:10]**  
**Dr. Torres:** That’s a common fear, especially when we’re under pressure to perform. Can you tell me about how you’ve been managing your stress when these thoughts come up?  

**Diego:** I try to breathe deeply or do some quick mindfulness, but it doesn’t always help. Sometimes I just get stuck in the “what if I mess up” loop.  

**Dr. Torres:** It’s good you’ve been practicing mindfulness. Remember, it’s a skill that takes time to strengthen. Would you like to review some cognitive restructuring techniques today to challenge those perfectionist thoughts?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I think that would help. It’s frustrating feeling like I’m stuck in this loop.  

**[11:20]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Absolutely. Let’s take a moment to identify the automatic thoughts. When you think, “I might mess up,” what’s the evidence for that?  

**Diego:** Well, I’ve made small mistakes before, and I tend to overthink every detail, so that’s part of it. I guess I feel like if I don’t get everything perfect, I’ll be judged badly.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s insightful. Now, what’s the evidence against that? Are there times you’ve done well or received positive feedback?  

**Diego:** Yes, in my last presentation, I got good feedback from my advisor, and I managed to stay calm during the Q&A.  

**Dr. Torres:** Exactly. So, the evidence suggests you’re capable and prepared. How might you reframe the thought from “I’ll fail” to something more balanced?  

**Diego:** Maybe, “I’ve prepared as well as I can, and I’ll do my best. Even if I make mistakes, it’s part of learning.”  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a strong, realistic reframe. Practice saying that to yourself when those anxious thoughts arise. Would you like to try a quick role-play now?  

**Diego:** Sure, I can do that.  

**[11:30]**  
*(Role-play ensues where Diego practices challenging a negative thought about the presentation.)*  

**Dr. Torres:** Great job. Remember, these cognitive techniques are tools you can use in real-time, especially before and during stressful moments. Now, shifting gears a bit—how are your social confidence and campus interactions going?  

**Diego:** Actually, I’ve been trying to attend some group study sessions and club events, but I still feel pretty shy. I hesitate to start conversations or share my ideas.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s understandable, especially in a new environment. What’s one small step you could take to ease into social interactions?  

**Diego:** Maybe I could start by saying hello to a few classmates or asking a question about the project.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a good strategy. Small, manageable steps build confidence over time. How did it feel to attend the study group last week?  

**Diego:** It was nerve-wracking at first, but once I got into the discussion, I felt a bit more comfortable. Still, I worry about not contributing enough or sounding awkward.  

**Dr. Torres:** It’s normal to feel that way. Remember, most people appreciate genuine effort. You can prepare a couple of questions or comments in advance, which can ease the pressure. Would you like to set a goal for this week related to social exposure?  

**Diego:** Yes, I think I’ll try to introduce myself to at least two classmates and ask one question during the next study session.  

**Dr. Torres:** Excellent. Let’s also touch on your sleep. You mentioned feeling tired during the day. How has your sleep hygiene been lately?  

**[11:40]**  
**Diego:** Honestly, I’ve been staying up late working on my research, so my sleep schedule’s been inconsistent. I often wake up feeling groggy.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s common with irregular sleep. Have you been implementing any of the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed, like limiting screen time before bed or establishing a relaxing routine?  

**Diego:** Not as much as I should. I often get caught up in coding or reading research papers late into the night.  

**Dr. Torres:** It’s easy to get absorbed, especially when you’re passionate. Let’s try a quick exercise now—imagine your ideal sleep routine. What would it look like?  

**Diego:** Probably, I’d turn off screens an hour before bed, do some light stretching or reading, and go to sleep around 11 pm.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a solid plan. Would you be willing to set a goal to implement these habits for the next week?  

**Diego:** Yeah, I can try that. I think it would help me feel more rested and less anxious during the day.  

**[11:50]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Great. To wrap up, let’s review your action items:  
- Practice cognitive restructuring daily when anxious thoughts about the presentation come up.  
- Initiate small social interactions—say hello to two classmates and ask a question at your next study group.  
- Begin implementing a consistent sleep routine, turning off screens an hour before bed.  

Does that sound doable?  

**Diego:** Yes, I think so. It’s a manageable plan, and I appreciate having concrete steps.  

**Dr. Torres:** Excellent. Next time, we can review how these strategies are working and explore any new challenges. Remember, progress is gradual, and you’re making meaningful steps.  

**Diego:** Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel more optimistic about handling these things now.  

**Dr. Torres:** I’m glad to hear that. Keep practicing, and I look forward to hearing about your successes next week.  

**[12:00]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Keep well, Diego. Have a good week!  

**Diego:** Thanks, you too!
