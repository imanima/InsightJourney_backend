Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[11:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Diego, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or things you'd like to focus on today?

[11:05] Diego: Hey, Dr. Torres. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my coursework and trying to get my research projects off the ground. I also had a couple of social events last week, but I still find myself pretty anxious in new group settings.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: That sounds like a lot to juggle. It’s great you’re pushing yourself to attend social events, even if it’s challenging. How did those experiences feel afterward? Any particular moments that stood out?

[11:15] Diego: Well, at the last event, I managed to introduce myself to a few people, which was a big step. But I also felt that rush of anxiety when I was waiting for my turn to speak, and I kept worrying about saying the wrong thing.

[11:20] Dr. Torres: That’s a common experience—anticipating negative judgment can be quite stressful. Remember, in our previous sessions, we worked on some mindfulness exercises to ground yourself in the moment. Have you been practicing those outside of our sessions?

[11:25] Diego: I’ve tried a couple of times, especially during study breaks, but I admit I forget sometimes when I’m really anxious.

[11:30] Dr. Torres: That’s normal; it takes time to integrate these techniques. Let’s revisit that shortly. First, I want to acknowledge your effort—each step like introducing yourself is progress. Now, regarding your research and coursework, what specific stressors are impacting your focus right now?

[11:35] Diego: Mainly the pressure to perform well. I feel like I need to prove myself, especially since I came from a different background. Sometimes I catch myself obsessing over every detail in my data analysis, which slows me down.

[11:40] Dr. Torres: That perfectionist tendency can definitely add to your stress. Remember we discussed cognitive restructuring techniques? For example, challenging the thought “I have to be perfect or I’ll fail.” Can you think of a recent instance where you had that thought?

[11:45] Diego: Yeah, last week, I spent hours trying to optimize my machine learning model, worried that if I didn’t get it right, I’d fall behind.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: That’s a common scenario. How about we try reframing that thought now? Instead of “I must be perfect,” maybe consider, “Doing my best is enough, and mistakes are part of learning.” Would you like to give it a try?

[11:55] Diego: Sure. (pauses) Okay, “Doing my best is enough, and mistakes are part of learning.” I guess that’s more realistic.

[11:58] Dr. Torres: Exactly. This shift can reduce some of the pressure. Now, relating to your social anxiety, I remember we discussed exposure exercises. How often have you been practicing initiating conversations or attending social settings?

[12:05] Diego: I’ve been trying to push myself to say hi to classmates or join study groups, but I still get pretty nervous. Last week, I missed a couple of opportunities because I felt too anxious.

[12:10] Dr. Torres: That’s perfectly normal. Exposure takes time, and each attempt is a step forward. Remember, the goal is not perfection but gradually reducing your anxiety response. Would you be comfortable setting a small, specific goal for this week? For example, saying hello to someone new each day?

[12:15] Diego: Yeah, I think I can do that. It’s manageable.

[12:20] Dr. Torres: Great. Let’s also revisit the mindfulness exercises. Have you tried the breathing technique we discussed—focusing on your breath for a few minutes when anxiety spikes?

[12:25] Diego: I’ve tried it a couple of times, especially before presentations. It helps a little, but I sometimes forget to do it when I’m really nervous.

[12:30] Dr. Torres: That’s common. A suggestion is to set a reminder on your phone or keep a small note nearby to prompt you. Over time, it will become more automatic. Also, integrating these practices into your routine can help build resilience.

[12:35] Diego: That makes sense. I’ll try that. I also wanted to ask about balancing my study schedule because I tend to procrastinate or get stuck on difficult problems.

[12:40] Dr. Torres: A good approach is to break tasks into smaller, manageable steps and set specific, time-limited goals. Have you been using your study planner or any apps to structure your time?

[12:45] Diego: I’ve used a digital to-do list, but I sometimes get distracted or spend too long on a single task.

[12:50] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Techniques like the Pomodoro method—working for focused intervals, like 25 minutes, then taking a 5-minute break—can enhance focus. Would you like to try incorporating that into your study sessions this week?

[12:55] Diego: Yeah, I can try that. It might help me stay on track.

[12:58] Dr. Torres: Excellent. To wrap up, I want to highlight your progress—you're working on challenging social situations, applying cognitive strategies, and experimenting with new study techniques. These are all positive steps.

Next week, we can explore any barriers you faced with these goals and perhaps introduce some sleep hygiene strategies, as sleep often impacts stress and focus. Does that sound good?

[13:05] Diego: Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel like I have some concrete steps now.

[13:10] Dr. Torres: Wonderful, Diego. Keep practicing the techniques we discussed, and remember, change takes time. I’ll see you next week, and feel free to reach out if you need support before then.

[13:15] Diego: Thanks. See you next week.
