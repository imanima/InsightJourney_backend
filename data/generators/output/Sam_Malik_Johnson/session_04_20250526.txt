Session 4/24
Date: May 26, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Sam. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any new developments or reflections you'd like to share?

[09:04] Sam: Morning, Malik. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been feeling some creative stagnation, but I also started sketching out some new ideas for a project I’d kind of put aside. So, that part feels promising.

[09:07] Malik: That’s interesting—a spark of creativity emerging. When you mention sketching out ideas, can you tell me more about what’s coming up for you? Are these related to your previous game concepts or something entirely new?

[09:10] Sam: Mostly new. I’ve been thinking about a game set in a surreal, dream-like world, but I’m still figuring out the core mechanic. It’s different from my usual style, which is more grounded and story-driven. I feel excited but also a bit unsure if I can pull it off.

[09:14] Malik: That’s a big shift, and it sounds like you’re exploring uncharted territory. It’s quite common to feel unsure when trying something new. How does this idea resonate with your core values or the stories you want to tell through your games?

[09:17] Sam: Well, I guess storytelling has always been at the heart of my work. I want to evoke emotion, maybe even challenge players’ perceptions. But I also worry about whether I have the skills for a more abstract, atmospheric style.

[09:21] Malik: It’s great that you’re aware of your storytelling passion. Sometimes, shifting styles can be an opportunity to expand your narrative toolkit. Have you thought about framing this project as a hero’s journey—perhaps positioning yourself as the hero venturing into new creative realms?

[09:24] Sam: I like that idea. I haven't mapped it out fully, but I can see myself as the hero, facing doubt and discovering new strengths along the way. It feels empowering, actually.

[09:27] Malik: Excellent. That narrative framing can serve as a powerful motivator. Remember, your story isn’t just about the project but also about your growth through this process. How does that perspective sit with you?

[09:30] Sam: It feels right. I think I’ve been too focused on the fear of failure and not enough on the potential for learning and resilience. The hero story reminds me that setbacks are part of the journey.

[09:34] Malik: Exactly. And just like a hero faces obstacles and learns from them, your creative process can incorporate that resilience. Speaking of which, how are you managing your energy and motivation these days? Any burnout signals?

[09:37] Sam: Honestly, yes. I’ve been working long hours, especially after the split with my co-founder. Sometimes I feel isolated, and it’s hard to stay motivated when I don’t have that collaborative feedback loop anymore.

[09:41] Malik: That’s understandable. Isolation can be tough, especially for a creative who thrives on feedback. Have you considered building a support network—perhaps connecting with other indie developers, online or locally? Or maybe finding a community that shares your artistic vision?

[09:45] Sam: I’ve thought about joining some online forums, but I haven’t taken the step yet. I tend to work alone most of the time, partly by choice, partly out of habit.

[09:48] Malik: Sometimes, reaching out can be a leap, but it often opens doors to fresh ideas and encouragement. Maybe we can brainstorm ways to make that easier for you—like setting small goals to connect with one or two people or groups?

[09:52] Sam: Yeah, I think I could do that. Just sending a message or commenting on a post seems manageable. I guess I’ve been avoiding it because I worry about rejection or seeming vulnerable.

[09:55] Malik: That’s a common fear, but remember, most communities are welcoming, especially when you’re genuine about your interests. Your story as an independent developer is compelling, and sharing it could inspire others—and boost your motivation.

[09:59] Sam: That makes sense. I’ll try to take that first step this week. Maybe even share my current project sketch and ask for feedback.

[10:02] Malik: Great plan. Now, circling back to your creative process, what resources or tools could help you stay energized and organized? You mentioned AI and open-source contributions earlier.

[10:05] Sam: Yeah, I’ve been experimenting with some AI tools for generating ideas and prototyping. It’s been helpful, but I also feel like I need more structure—like a clear roadmap or milestones.

[10:08] Malik: That’s a smart approach. Creating a visual journey map or timeline could help you see your progress and stay motivated. We could work on a simple project plan together, aligning your goals with your values and available resources.

[10:11] Sam: I’d like that. Having a visual plan might make the workload feel more manageable and give me a sense of direction.

[10:14] Malik: Perfect. Let’s plan to integrate that into our next session, perhaps using Miro or another visual tool. For today, I want to acknowledge your resilience—navigating creative shifts, personal challenges, and now building new support systems. That’s a lot.

[10:17] Sam: Thanks, Malik. I appreciate that. Sometimes I forget to recognize my own progress.

[10:20] Malik: That’s normal. Remember, your story is one of growth and adaptation. You’re actively shaping a new chapter, and that’s something to be proud of. Before we wrap up, what’s one small action you’re committed to taking before our next session?

[10:23] Sam: I will reach out to at least two online communities or individuals this week, share my project sketch, and ask for feedback.

[10:26] Malik: Excellent. That’s a concrete step that aligns with your goals. And I’ll send you some resources on creating effective support networks and project roadmaps. Any final thoughts or questions today?

[10:29] Sam: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Malik. I feel more focused and motivated after this chat.

[10:32] Malik: Glad to hear it. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Keep being kind to yourself, and remember—you’re the hero of your story. Have a great week, Sam.

[10:35] Sam: Thanks, Malik. You too.
