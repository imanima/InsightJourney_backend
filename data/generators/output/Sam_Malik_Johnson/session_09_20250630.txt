Session 9/24
Date: June 30, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Sam. It’s great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
Sam: Hey Malik. Honestly, I’ve been a bit restless this week. Still feeling the weight of that split with my co-founder. It’s like I lost a part of my creative team.  
Malik: That sounds really tough. Losing that partnership must have shaken your creative confidence a bit. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been on your mind most lately?  

09:10  
Sam: Yeah, I think I’ve been stuck in a loop—thinking about what’s next, but I can’t seem to get past the feeling of being alone in this. My usual motivation just isn’t there. I’ve been streaming a lot of game tutorials, trying to find inspiration, but nothing’s really clicking.  
Malik: It’s understandable to feel that way after such a significant change. Sometimes, when our usual sources of inspiration fade, it’s a signal that we might need to reframe our story. Remember last session, we talked about your core values? How does that perspective sit with you now?  

09:20  
Sam: Yeah, I remember. I said I value independence and creativity. But lately, I wonder if I’ve been too isolated. Maybe I need to build a support network, like you said. I just don’t know where to start.  
Malik: That’s a really insightful observation. Building a support network doesn’t mean you have to do it all at once. It can start with small connections—perhaps engaging with other indie developers online, joining forums, or attending virtual meetups. Would you be open to identifying some specific groups or communities that align with your interests?  

09:30  
Sam: Yeah, I think I could look into some Discord channels or Reddit groups. I’ve been hesitant because I don’t want to feel like I’m bothering people or that I’m not good enough.  
Malik: That’s a common feeling, especially when reaching out feels vulnerable. Remember, most communities are built on shared passion, and many members are eager to connect with someone new who shares their interest. What if we framed this as a story—your story of seeking connection as a hero on a journey? How might that narrative look?  

09:40  
Sam: Hmm, I guess I see myself as someone on a quest to find allies—like a hero gathering a team for the next big challenge. Maybe I’ve been viewing this as a sign of weakness, but really, it’s part of the adventure.  
Malik: Exactly. Reframing your experience as a hero’s journey can empower you. It emphasizes resilience, growth, and the importance of allies. Now, thinking about your creative block—have you noticed any patterns or triggers that intensify this feeling?  

09:50  
Sam: Well, I think when I feel overwhelmed financially or when I compare myself to other developers who seem further along, that’s when the block hits hardest. It’s like I forget why I started this in the first place.  
Malik: Comparing ourselves to others can be a tough trap. Let’s try a story reframing exercise. Imagine your current situation as part of your hero’s backstory—your struggles, setbacks—they all serve to deepen your character. What strengths have you demonstrated in facing these challenges?  

10:00  
Sam: I guess I’ve shown resilience, for sure. Even after the split, I kept working on my projects instead of giving up. Also, I’ve learned a lot technically, and I’ve been resourceful—finding new tools and ways to improve my skills.  
Malik: Those are powerful strengths. Your resilience and resourcefulness are like your hero’s armor—crucial for moving forward. How might you use these strengths to set a small, achievable goal for this week?  

10:10  
Sam: Maybe I could set aside time to revisit my game ideas, but with a new angle—maybe focusing on a shorter, more manageable project that I can finish quickly. It could help rebuild my confidence.  
Malik: That sounds like a fantastic step. Focusing on a small win can reignite your creative energy and give you a sense of progress. Let’s also think about your resource planning—do you have any tools or contacts that could support this new project?  

10:20  
Sam: I have a few open-source assets I’ve been meaning to incorporate, and I could reach out to some of the folks I’ve collaborated with before. Maybe even ask for feedback on a prototype.  
Malik: Excellent. Leveraging your existing resources and your network aligns with your strengths. Now, to support your goal and maintain momentum, how about scheduling a specific time this week for your project work, and maybe a quick check-in with someone from your network?  

10:30  
Sam: Yeah, I can do that. I’ll block out a couple of hours on Wednesday afternoon, and I’ll send a message to my old collaborator today.  
Malik: Perfect. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on your story arc. You’ve acknowledged the setbacks, identified your strengths, and created a plan for small wins. How are you feeling about your next steps?  

10:40  
Sam: Honestly, more hopeful than I have in a while. Framing things as a hero’s journey makes it feel less overwhelming and more manageable.  
Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, your story is ongoing, and each step you take adds to your narrative of resilience and creativity. For next time, I’d like you to journal about your progress, noting any new insights or challenges. Would that work?  

10:50  
Sam: Definitely. I’ll start that tonight. Thanks, Malik. This really helped me see things differently.  
Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Sam. You’re making meaningful strides. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a great week ahead—stay curious and kind to yourself.  

Sam: Thanks, I will. See you next week.
