Session 16/24
Date: August 18, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[09:02] Sam: Hey, Malik. Thanks. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve had some moments of clarity but also felt pretty stuck at times. The creative block is still there, but I’ve been trying to push through.

[09:05] Malik: That’s understandable. Creative blocks can be persistent, especially when you’re also managing the emotional weight of the co-founder split. Last time, we discussed your desire to find a new direction that aligns with your core values. Have you had any new insights or reflections since then?

[09:07] Sam: Yeah, I did some journaling after our last session. I revisited my story about why I started game development in the first place. It reminded me of the thrill of creating worlds and stories that could make people feel something. But I also realized that lately, I’ve been more focused on just keeping afloat financially, and that’s been draining.

[09:10] Malik: That’s a powerful realization. Connecting back to your original motivation can be a strong anchor. When you think about those early days, what aspects of creating that brought you joy or purpose?

[09:12] Sam: I loved designing characters and stories that felt authentic. I wanted to tell stories that mattered, even if they were small. But now, it's like I’ve been stuck in survival mode, and that’s overshadowed the passion.

[09:15] Malik: It sounds like your passion is still alive beneath the surface, but the current circumstances have made it harder to access. Let’s explore how you might reconnect with that initial spark. Have you considered a creative visualization exercise before our session?

[09:17] Sam: Not really, but I’m open to trying.

[09:20] Malik: Great. I’d like you to close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine yourself back at the start of your journey—your first project, that feeling of excitement. Visualize yourself creating something you truly loved. What do you see, hear, or feel in that moment?

[09:22] (Brief silence as Sam visualizes)

[09:25] Sam: I see myself sitting at my desk, lights dim, just completely immersed. I hear the clicking of keys, and I feel this rush of excitement—like I’m discovering something new.

[09:27] Malik: Beautiful. That immersive feeling of discovery and passion—can you hold onto that feeling? Maybe even write down or record anything that came up during the visualization.

[09:30] Sam: Yeah, I’ll do that. It’s helpful to remember why I started.

[09:32] Malik: Excellent. Now, thinking about your current projects, what’s one idea or direction that excites you, even a little?

[09:35] Sam: Well, I’ve been playing around with an idea for a narrative-driven puzzle game that incorporates AI elements—like players collaborating with an AI to solve mysteries. It feels fresh and aligns with my tech skills.

[09:38] Malik: That sounds intriguing. How does that idea connect with your core motivation of storytelling and authentic experiences?

[09:40] Sam: I think it’s a way to blend storytelling with interactivity and tech—making the player feel like they’re part of the story, which excites me.

[09:43] Malik: Perfect. Let’s explore some practical steps. Have you considered breaking this project into smaller milestones to make it more manageable? For example, defining the story arc, building a prototype, or testing the AI interaction?

[09:45] Sam: Yeah, I think I need to do that. Sometimes, I get overwhelmed with the big picture and forget to take it step-by-step.

[09:48] Malik: That’s a common challenge. Using your strengths as a storyteller, you can create a hero’s journey map for this project—visualizing each stage as a chapter in your story. Would you like to try mapping out the initial phase now?

[09:50] Sam: Sure. I think I can do that.

[09:52] (Sam sketches a simple journey map on a digital tool, with stages like ‘Concept Development,’ ‘Prototype Creation,’ ‘User Testing,’ and ‘Iteration.’)

[09:55] Malik: Excellent work. Recognizing these stages helps make the project less daunting. Now, considering your resource constraints, what support or connections might help you move forward more confidently?

[09:58] Sam: I’ve been meaning to reconnect with some open-source communities and maybe find a mentor or collaborator who’s experienced with AI in gaming.

[10:00] Malik: That’s a great idea. Building a support network can provide both technical guidance and emotional encouragement. Have you thought about reaching out to specific groups or forums?

[10:02] Sam: I’ve looked at a few Discord servers and GitHub projects, but I haven’t taken the step to introduce myself yet. I guess I’m worried about sounding inexperienced.

[10:05] Malik: Many people feel that way at first. Remember, your experience and unique perspective are valuable. Sometimes, just sharing your passion and goals can open doors. How about drafting a brief introduction or message you can send out this week?

[10:07] Sam: That sounds doable. I’ll try that.

[10:10] Malik: Good. As we wrap up today, let’s set a couple of action items. First, continue your journaling, focusing on what excites you about your projects. Second, reach out to one community or individual about your AI game idea. And third, keep refining your hero journey map for this project.

[10:12] Sam: Okay, I’ll do those. Thanks, Malik. This helps me feel more grounded and motivated.

[10:15] Malik: You’re making great progress, Sam. Remember, reconnecting with your passion and building your support network are vital steps. I look forward to hearing about your next steps. See you next week!

[10:17] Sam: Thanks again. See you next week.
