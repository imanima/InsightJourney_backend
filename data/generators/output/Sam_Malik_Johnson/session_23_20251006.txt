09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Sam. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Sam: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay. Honestly, a bit restless. I’ve been trying to push through some creative blocks, but it’s been tough.  
Malik: That’s understandable. Creative blocks can be really draining, especially when you’re also dealing with the emotional aftermath of your co-founder split. Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns lately?  
Sam: Yeah, I think I’ve been feeling more alone. Without my partner, I’m questioning if I can sustain my projects or if I should pivot entirely. Sometimes I feel stuck in this limbo.  
Malik: That’s a very natural feeling after such a significant change. It’s good you’re aware of it. Let’s explore that limbo a bit—what stories are you telling yourself about your situation right now?  
Sam: Well, I keep thinking I might have made a mistake by going solo. Maybe I should have waited longer to build a bigger team. It’s like I’m doubting my skills and my vision.  
Malik: That’s a powerful narrative—doubting your capabilities. But from what I know about you, your resilience and technical skills are impressive. Can you recall a time in your journey when you faced a challenge and overcame it?  
Sam: Hmm, yeah. When I first started, I had no formal training, just tutorials and YouTube videos. I remember feeling overwhelmed, but I kept experimenting and eventually built my first playable demo. That was a huge confidence boost.  
Malik: Exactly. That story of persistence is part of your hero’s journey. How might reframing your current situation with that same resilience help you now?  
Sam: Maybe I can see this as another challenge I can overcome, not an end. Like, I’ve been through tough times before, and I’ve come out stronger.  
Malik: That’s a powerful shift. Recognizing your past victories can fuel your current motivation. Let’s try a visualization exercise—picture yourself in six months. What does success look like for you?  
Sam: (pauses, eyes close) I see myself with a new project, maybe collaborating with other developers online. I’ve built a support network, and my income is more stable. I feel excited and less lonely.  
Malik: That’s a wonderful vision. What resources or actions do you think will help you get there?  
Sam: I think I need to reconnect with some of my open-source communities and maybe attend a game dev meetup or online conference. Also, I should set aside regular time for creative work without distractions.  
Malik: Those sound like solid steps. How about creating a resource map—listing your current supports and areas where you need to build more?  
Sam: Good idea. I already contribute to a few forums and have some friends I can reach out to. I should also look into online groups or mentorship programs.  
Malik: Excellent. Building that support network will be key, especially for emotional and creative reinforcement. Considering your goal of stabilizing income, have you thought about diversifying your revenue streams?  
Sam: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about creating some assets I can sell, like asset packs or tutorials. But I worry about spreading myself too thin.  
Malik: That’s a common concern. Let’s explore how you can align these ideas with your core values and strengths. What do you enjoy most about your work?  
Sam: I love building worlds and telling stories through gameplay. It’s really fulfilling when players tell me they love my games.  
Malik: That’s a strong purpose. When your work aligns with your passion for storytelling, it becomes more sustainable and meaningful. How might you incorporate more of that into your current projects or future endeavors?  
Sam: Maybe I can focus on smaller, more narrative-rich projects that I can complete faster, rather than big, complex games that take years.  
Malik: That sounds like a great way to keep your creative energy flowing and build momentum. Moving forward, what’s one specific action you’ll commit to before our next session?  
Sam: I’ll reach out to at least two people in my network—either from the forums or online meetups—and schedule a chat. Also, I’ll draft a list of project ideas that focus on storytelling.  
Malik: Perfect. That will give you a clear starting point. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling about your creative direction now compared to when we started today?  
Sam: I feel a bit more hopeful and focused. Reframing my story and visualizing success helped remind me of what I’m capable of.  
Malik: That’s wonderful progress. Remember, your journey is ongoing, and each step you take is part of your hero’s story. We’ll keep building on this next week.  
Sam: Thanks, Malik. I appreciate your support and the tools you’ve shared.  
Malik: You’re very welcome. Let’s check in next week with your updates. Have a great week, Sam.  
Sam: Thanks, you too. Bye.  
Malik: Goodbye.
