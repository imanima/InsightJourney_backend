Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 [Session Start]  
Malik: Good morning, Sam! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Sam: Hey Malik. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel like I’m making progress, and other days I hit a wall with creative blocks.  
Malik: That’s completely normal, especially after such a big shift with your co-founder and the uncertainties around your next project. Do you want to start by sharing what’s been most prominent for you this week?  

09:10  
Sam: Yeah. I’ve been trying to work on that new game idea we talked about last time, but I keep getting stuck on the story. I feel disconnected from my original spark, like I’ve lost my creative energy.  
Malik: I hear that. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit drained and unsure about your creative flow. When you say ‘lost your spark,’ can you tell me more about what that feeling looks like for you?  

09:20  
Sam: It’s like... I used to get excited about new ideas, but now I just feel overwhelmed. I look at my old sketches and concepts, and I wonder if I should keep going or just start over. It’s hard to find motivation.  
Malik: That’s a very common experience, especially after a big change like splitting with your co-founder. Sometimes, our stories get tangled in doubts. Have you noticed any moments recently when you felt genuinely inspired or energized about your work?  

09:30  
Sam: Actually, yes. Last week, I spent a couple of evenings tinkering with some AI tools for storytelling, and I kind of got caught up in the possibilities again. It felt good to experiment without pressure.  
Malik: That’s a great insight. It seems like exploring new tech, like AI, rekindled your creative energy. How might you build on that experience? Could you incorporate more of that exploratory work into your routine?  

09:40  
Sam: I think I could. Maybe I need to set aside specific times just for experimenting, without the pressure to finish anything. Just play around and see what ideas come up.  
Malik: That’s a powerful strategy—dedicated creative play. It aligns with your strengths as an independent developer who thrives on experimentation. How does that feel to you?  

Sam: Honestly, it feels relieving. Like I don’t have to force ideas, just let them come naturally. But I also worry about the financial side; I need to keep some steady income.  
Malik: Absolutely, balancing creativity and financial stability is key. Have you thought about ways to integrate your experimental work into potential income streams? For example, sharing your process on platforms, or offering small workshops?  

09:50  
Sam: I hadn’t really considered that. I do share some behind-the-scenes stuff on YouTube, but I haven’t thought about monetizing that more intentionally. Maybe I could create a series around AI storytelling or game design insights.  
Malik: That’s a promising avenue. It could serve both as a creative outlet and a support network, connecting you with others who share your interests. How comfortable do you feel about reaching out to your existing network or building new connections?  

10:00  
Sam: I tend to be pretty introverted, so reaching out feels intimidating. But I realize I need to build a community — I just don’t know where to start.  
Malik: Building a community can indeed feel daunting, especially when you're used to working solo. Let’s think about small, manageable steps. Maybe you could join online forums or Discord groups focused on indie game devs or AI in gaming? Or even attend virtual meetups?  

10:10  
Sam: That makes sense. I’ve seen some active groups, but I’ve been hesitant to jump in. Maybe starting with small comments or sharing my ideas could help me ease in.  
Malik: Exactly. Starting small can reduce the overwhelm. Plus, sharing your story—your journey with AI and game development—can resonate with others and foster genuine connections. Do you recall the hero’s journey mapping we did in earlier sessions? How might your story fit into that framework now?  

10:20  
Sam: Hmm. I guess I could see myself as the hero who faced a big challenge—losing my co-founder—and now I’m on a quest to find new purpose and innovation. That narrative feels more empowering than just feeling lost.  
Malik: Beautiful. Framing your experience as a hero’s journey emphasizes resilience and growth. How might this story inspire others and also reinforce your own motivation?  

Sam: I like that. It makes my struggles feel like part of a bigger story of growth, not just setbacks. I think I can use that to stay motivated and to tell a more compelling story through my work.  
Malik: That’s a strong insight. Your story of overcoming adversity can indeed become a core part of your personal brand. Let’s also touch on your values—what matters most to you in your work and life right now?  

10:30  
Sam: Creativity, independence, and making a meaningful impact. I want my games to inspire people and also stay true to my vision, not just chase trends.  
Malik: Those values are powerful anchors. When you align your projects with them, it can help clarify your direction and provide motivation during tough times. How can you ensure your upcoming work reflects these core values?  

Sam: Maybe I can set goals that focus on meaningful storytelling instead of just commercial success. Also, collaborating with others who share my vision could help me stay aligned.  
Malik: Excellent. Collaboration and purpose-driven goals will reinforce your authentic voice. As we wrap up, what’s one concrete step you can commit to before our next session?  

Sam: I’ll draft a small story outline based on my hero’s journey and share a teaser on my social media platforms. Also, I’ll look into joining at least one online community this week.  
Malik: That sounds like a great plan. I look forward to hearing how sharing your story goes and hearing about any new connections you make. For next time, we can explore how to deepen these community ties and develop your next creative project.  

Sam: Thanks, Malik. I feel more focused and energized already.  
Malik: Wonderful. Remember, your story is your strength. See you next week!
