Session 5/24
Date: June 02, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
Sam: Hi Malik. Honestly, a bit of a mixed bag. Still feeling the creative block, but also hopeful about finding some clarity.  

09:05  
Malik: That’s completely understandable. Creative blocks can be persistent, especially after a major transition like the split with your co-founder. Last week, we touched on your core motivations—how are those feeling today?  
Sam: I think I’m still drawn to making games that tell meaningful stories, but I keep questioning if I should pivot to something different or stick with what I know.  

09:10  
Malik: That's a common dilemma—staying the course versus exploring new directions. Remember, in our last session, you mentioned wanting to build a support network. How has that been going?  
Sam: Well, I reached out to a couple of indie dev groups online, but I haven’t really connected deeply yet. Part of me feels like I should be more proactive, but I also feel a bit isolated.  

09:15  
Malik: That’s a good start, reaching out is a significant step. Sometimes, networks grow gradually. Let’s explore—what kind of support would feel most meaningful to you right now?  
Sam: Honestly, I think I need people who understand the technical side but also get the emotional ups and downs of solo development. Like, peers I can vent to and brainstorm with.  

09:20  
Malik: That makes sense. Building that kind of community can be very nourishing. Have you thought about creating a small mastermind group or joining a local meet-up?  
Sam: I’ve considered it, but I worry about vulnerability. I don’t want to come across as inexperienced or insecure.  

09:25  
Malik: That’s a common concern. Remember, vulnerability is actually a strength in these contexts—it fosters authenticity and connection. Think of it as sharing your hero’s journey, showing both the struggles and the growth. Would you be open to framing your story that way in these groups?  
Sam: Yeah, I guess I could try that. It might help others relate, and it might also help me see my own story in a new light.  

09:30  
Malik: Excellent. Let’s switch gears a bit. You mentioned feeling creatively blocked. Can you tell me more about that? When do you notice it the most?  
Sam: It hits when I try to work on my current project—a puzzle-platformer. I stare at the screen, and the ideas just don’t come. I feel stuck, like I’ve lost my spark.  

09:35  
Malik: That sense of losing your spark—have you noticed if it’s related to certain thoughts or feelings? For example, fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else?  
Sam: I think it’s mostly fear of not being good enough. Like, what if my ideas aren’t original or interesting enough to stand out?  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a very common fear among creative entrepreneurs. Sometimes, it’s about reframing the story we tell ourselves. Instead of “My ideas aren’t good enough,” could we explore a narrative like, “Every idea is a step forward, and my unique perspective matters”?  
Sam: I like that. It’s hard to believe it sometimes, but I want to try shifting that story.  

09:45  
Malik: Great. Let’s visualize your creative process as a hero’s journey. Imagine your current project as a quest—what’s the ‘call to adventure’ that brought you into game development?  
Sam: I think it was a desire to create worlds where players feel like they’re part of something meaningful. I wanted to tell stories that matter.  

09:50  
Malik: And now, perhaps the ‘roadblocks’ are the monsters or trials you face. The creative block, the fear of inadequacy. Recognizing these as part of the journey can help you see them differently. How does that perspective feel?  
Sam: It makes it seem less like failure and more like a necessary part of growth. Like, I’m still on my quest.  

09:55  
Malik: Exactly. And every hero faces setbacks—they’re essential to the story. Now, thinking about your next steps, what resources or support can you tap into to keep moving forward?  
Sam: Maybe I can set small, manageable goals—like finishing a level design or writing a story snippet—and share those progress updates with a group.  

10:00  
Malik: That’s a powerful strategy. Breaking down big projects into smaller stories keeps the momentum and builds confidence. For our next session, I’d like you to try reaching out to at least one indie dev group or community, and create a small story about your hero’s journey in your game. How does that sound?  
Sam: Sounds good. I’ll give it a shot. Thanks, Malik. I already feel a bit more motivated just talking about these ideas.  

10:05  
Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, your story is unique, and your voice matters. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind today?  
Sam: Just that I appreciate the focus on reframing and storytelling. It feels more aligned with who I am as a developer.  

10:10  
Malik: I’m glad. Our work is really about unlocking your narrative power, both in your projects and your life. Next week, we’ll explore your long-term vision and how to align it with your current projects. Keep nurturing those stories—both the ones you tell others and the ones you tell yourself.  
Sam: Will do. Thanks again, Malik. See you next week.  

10:15  
Malik: Take care, Sam. Have a creative and reflective week.
