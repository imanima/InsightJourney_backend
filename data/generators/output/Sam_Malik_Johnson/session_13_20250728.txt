Session 13/24
Date: July 28, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Sam. Glad you could make it today. How are you feeling as we start this session?  
Sam: Hey Malik, honestly, a mix of tired but somewhat hopeful. I’ve been thinking a lot about the creative block I mentioned last time. Still feels like I’m stuck, but I also see some possibilities.  

09:10  
Malik: That’s a very honest place to be. Sometimes just recognizing that sense of being stuck is a step forward. Last week, we explored your core values and how they relate to your projects. Have you had any new insights or reflections since then?  
Sam: Yeah, actually. I revisited the story map we made last time, and I realized I tend to focus too much on the technical side and forget the narrative I want my games to tell. It’s like I’m building mechanics but not the story that drives the experience.  

09:20  
Malik: That’s a powerful realization. It sounds like reconnecting with the narrative aspect could reignite your creative energy. How do you feel about framing your next project around a strong story?  
Sam: I like that idea. Maybe I’ve been so caught up in perfecting the code that I lost sight of why I started this in the first place—to tell a compelling story. I think that’s what’s been missing.  

09:30  
Malik: Absolutely. We’ve discussed before how your strengths lie in technical innovation and storytelling. Combining those could be your unique edge. Do you remember the hero’s journey mapping we did? How might that framework inspire your next game concept?  
Sam: (smiles softly) I do remember. I think I could craft a story where the player is on a journey of discovery, facing challenges that mirror my own experience of overcoming creative doubts. That personal touch might make the game more authentic.  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a beautiful way to turn your personal story into a universal experience for players. It also aligns with your goal of finding a new creative direction. Have you thought about how to incorporate your current skills and resources into this idea?  
Sam: Well, I’ve been working on some AI tools for generating story prompts and dialogues. Maybe I can use those to help develop the narrative structure or even prototype some scenes. It could be a way to combine my tech skills with storytelling.  

09:50  
Malik: Excellent. Using your tech tools to support your narrative vision can help reduce the overwhelm. How about your support network? Last time, we talked about building connections. Have you reached out to fellow developers or storytellers?  
Sam: I’ve joined a couple of online forums and started commenting on some open-source projects. It’s a small step, but I still feel a bit isolated, especially since my co-founder and I split up. No local meetups happening nearby.  

10:00  
Malik: Building a community takes time, but every small interaction counts. Perhaps setting a goal to collaborate on a project or share your narrative ideas could help deepen those connections. How does that sound?  
Sam: That makes sense. Maybe I can suggest a joint project or even just a storytelling session with someone I meet online. It might help me feel less alone and get some feedback.  

10:10  
Malik: Great plan. Remember, your story of resilience—shifting from solo work to collaborative efforts—can be a strength. It’s part of your narrative now. Have you thought about how you want to frame your next steps in terms of your career and creative projects?  
Sam: I think I want to focus on making a prototype that tells this personal journey. Something that can showcase both my technical skills and my storytelling. Maybe even pitch it as a narrative-driven experience that can attract funding or partnerships.  

10:20  
Malik: That’s a clear and inspiring goal. Visualizing that prototype as your “hero’s quest”—a tangible step toward your larger purpose—can energize your efforts. Do you want to do a quick visualization exercise now to deepen this image?  
Sam: Sure, I’m up for that.  

[Malik guides Sam through a brief visualization exercise focusing on imagining himself completing the prototype, feeling the sense of achievement and connection with his audience.]  

10:30  
Malik: How did that feel? Did any new images or feelings come up?  
Sam: Yeah, I saw myself presenting the game at a small indie showcase, feeling proud and connected because I was sharing a story that matters to me. It made me realize how much I want others to experience what I’ve created.  

10:40  
Malik: That’s a powerful vision. Holding onto that feeling can motivate you through the next phases. Before we wrap up, let’s identify one concrete action for the week. What feels most manageable and impactful?  
Sam: I’ll reach out to at least two people in those online forums, share my story idea, and see if they’re interested in collaborating or giving feedback. I’ll also sketch out a rough narrative outline for the prototype.  

10:50  
Malik: Excellent. Keep that focus on your story and your purpose. I’ll send you some prompts and resources to support your narrative development. Next session, we can review the outline and explore how to turn this into a pitch or a playable prototype.  
Sam: Thanks, Malik. I feel more motivated already. It’s good to have a clear direction again.  

11:00  
Malik: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, your story is your strength. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a great week, Sam.  
Sam: You too, Malik. Thanks again.
