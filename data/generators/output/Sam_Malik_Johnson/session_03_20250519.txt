Session 3/24
Date: May 19, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[09:02] Sam: Hi Malik. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling stuck again, especially with the creative block. I also had a rough week emotionally, feeling pretty isolated after parting ways with my co-founder.

[09:04] Malik: That sounds tough. It’s understandable to feel that way after such a significant change. Let’s start by checking in on how you’re managing your energy and motivation amidst these challenges. Did you find any moments of clarity or inspiration this week?

[09:06] Sam: I did try to do some brainstorming, but it felt forced. I spent a lot of time streaming YouTube tutorials and open-source projects—trying to get some ideas, but nothing really clicked. It’s like my brain is resistant.

[09:08] Malik: That’s a common experience during creative blocks—your mind is signaling you to rest or reset. Remember, sometimes stepping back can open space for new ideas. Looking back at the last session, we worked on identifying your core values and your passion for storytelling in games. Have you noticed any ways these insights have influenced your thinking lately?

[09:10] Sam: I think so. I revisited some old ideas that connected to my love for narrative—the kind of immersive, emotional stories I want to tell. But I still feel unsure how to turn that into a project that’s viable financially and creatively.

[09:12] Malik: That’s a valid concern. Let's explore how your storytelling strengths can serve as a foundation for your next project. Could you tell me about a moment when you felt most engaged or proud while working on your game ideas?

[09:14] Sam: Hmm… There was a time when I was experimenting with a character backstory, and I really got lost in their motivations. I felt energized, like I was uncovering a deeper narrative. That was a few weeks ago. But since then, it’s been hard to sustain that energy.

[09:16] Malik: That’s a powerful insight—your engagement peaks when you’re deep into character and story development. Maybe that’s a clue about what kind of projects would reignite your passion. Have you thought about focusing on narrative-driven prototypes or smaller stories that allow you to explore these characters more deeply?

[09:18] Sam: Yeah, I think I might try that. But I’m also worried about the financial side—how to make that sustainable, especially without the co-founder’s support.

[09:20] Malik: Absolutely, financial stability is crucial. Let’s look at your current resources and see where opportunities lie. You mentioned your open-source contributions and AI model work—how could those skills help you generate income or build a support network?

[09:22] Sam: Well, I could potentially offer consulting or workshops on AI integration in game development, or even publish tutorials. But I haven’t really taken steps toward that yet.

[09:24] Malik: That’s a good starting point. Small steps like creating a portfolio or sharing insights on social platforms can help establish your expertise. Plus, connecting with other indie developers online might expand your support network. Have you considered joining a community or forum focused on narrative games or AI in gaming?

[09:26] Sam: I’ve looked into some forums, but I haven’t been very active. I mostly work in isolation because I’m used to doing things independently.

[09:28] Malik: That independence is a strength, but even resilient creators benefit from community. Perhaps setting a goal to participate in one online discussion or attend a virtual meetup this week could be manageable. How does that sound?

[09:30] Sam: Yeah, I can try that. It might help me feel less alone and maybe even spark some new ideas.

[09:32] Malik: Excellent. Now, let’s revisit your hero journey map from our previous session. Remember how we identified your “call to adventure” as your passion for storytelling and your “trials” as dealing with creative doubts. How do you see that map fitting into your current situation?

[09:34] Sam: I guess I’m still in the trials phase—facing doubts and setbacks. But maybe I can see this as part of the hero’s growth, not a failure.

[09:36] Malik: Exactly. Framing this as a hero’s journey emphasizes resilience and transformation. Your current challenges are part of your story—an opportunity for growth and new discovery. What would the “return” or new phase look like for you?

[09:38] Sam: Perhaps it’s developing a new narrative game that combines AI storytelling techniques, with a stronger support network and clearer financial goals.

[09:40] Malik: That sounds like a powerful narrative arc—your next chapter. How confident do you feel about taking the first step toward that goal?

[09:42] Sam: I feel cautiously optimistic. I think I need to set some concrete, small goals—like reaching out to one developer community and sketching out a prototype idea.

[09:44] Malik: Great. Let’s make those your action items for this week. Also, to support your creative energy, I suggest dedicating some time to visualizing your ideal project—what it looks like, who it serves, and how it makes you feel. Would you like to try a brief visualization exercise now?

[09:46] Sam: Sure, I’d like that.

[09:48] Malik: Okay. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine yourself a few months from now, having started this new project. What are you doing? Who are you working with? How does it feel?

[09:50] (Sam pauses, takes a breath, then begins to speak softly)

Sam: I see myself collaborating online with other developers, sharing ideas, and working on a small, narrative-driven game. I feel excited and purposeful, like I’m finally creating something that aligns with my passions. It’s challenging but rewarding.

[09:52] Malik: Beautiful. Holding onto that vision can serve as motivation. Remember, your story is unfolding one step at a time. Before we finish, do you have any questions or thoughts about what we discussed today?

[09:54] Sam: Not questions, but I appreciate the focus on framing these challenges as part of my journey. It makes things feel less overwhelming.

[09:56] Malik: I’m glad to hear that. To summarize, this week you’ll reach out to at least one community, sketch out a prototype idea, and spend some time visualizing your ideal project regularly. Next session, we’ll review your progress and explore further steps in building your support network and project clarity.

[09:58] Sam: Sounds good. Thanks, Malik. I feel more hopeful already.

[10:00] Malik: You’re welcome, Sam. Remember, your story is powerful—keep writing it. See you next week.
