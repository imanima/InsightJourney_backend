Session 8/24
Date: June 23, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Sam! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Sam: Hey, Malik. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel more motivated, but other days I struggle with that creative block and the loneliness I mentioned.  
Malik: That’s understandable. It’s common during creative transitions, especially after your split with your co-founder. Let’s start with how you’ve been managing your project and your feelings around it this past week.  

09:10  
Sam: Well, I’ve tried to push through the block by sketching out some ideas for a new game concept, but I feel like I’m just spinning my wheels. I get excited at first, then I hit a wall. And honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty isolated, especially since I don’t have a co-founder anymore.  
Malik: That sounds exhausting—like you’re trying to keep momentum while also managing that sense of isolation. When you say you get excited at first, what’s that like for you? Can you tell me more about that initial spark?  
Sam: Sure. It’s like a burst of energy—I imagine the game, the mechanics, the story, and it feels really promising. But then, the doubt creeps in. I start questioning if I can pull it off alone, if I have enough support.  

09:20  
Malik: That’s a very human experience—big bursts of inspiration followed by doubts. Let’s think about that initial spark—what stories are you telling yourself about your creative process? Are there particular themes or narratives that come up?  
Sam: Honestly, I sometimes see myself as a ‘lone wolf,’ trying to do everything myself. It’s like I’m trying to prove I can succeed independently, but it’s also lonely. I wonder if I should ask for help or collaborate more, but I feel like I’m risking my independence.  
Malik: That’s a powerful story—"the lone wolf." It’s both a strength and a limitation. How might reframing that story help you see your independence as a resource rather than a barrier?  

09:30  
Sam: Hmm, I guess I could see my independence as a kind of resilience—something I’ve built up over years. Maybe I don’t have to do everything alone; I can be resilient by seeking support when needed.  
Malik: Exactly. Resilience isn’t just about pushing through solo—it’s about knowing when to lean on others. Sometimes, the hero’s journey involves allies. Have you thought about who in your network could be potential allies or collaborators?  
Sam: Not really. I’ve mostly been focused on my own work. But I do have some open-source contacts I’ve worked with before, and I could reach out to them.  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a good start. Let’s map out your support network. Who are the people or communities that could help you—mentors, peers, online forums? And how might you approach building a more active support system?  
Sam: I think I could join some developer communities online, maybe participate more actively. I also have a couple of friends who are into game design but aren’t developers themselves—they might offer some fresh perspectives.  
Malik: Great. Building that network can be both a resource for ideas and emotional support. Now, shifting gears a little—what about your creative process? When you hit a block, what do you usually do?  
Sam: I tend to get stuck in my head, overthinking every detail. Sometimes I try to force ideas, but that just makes it worse. I think I need to find a way to relax and let ideas develop more naturally.  

09:50  
Malik: That’s a common challenge for creatives. Have you ever tried techniques like free writing, visualizations, or stepping away from your work temporarily?  
Sam: I’ve done some visualizations before, like imagining the game’s world vividly, but I haven’t done it consistently. I do like the idea of taking breaks—they sometimes help me see things differently.  
Malik: Let’s incorporate a visualization exercise now. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Imagine your ideal game project—what’s the story, the visuals, the feelings it evokes?  
(Sam closes eyes, takes a deep breath)  
Sam: (pauses) I see a vibrant world, full of color, with a story about discovery and friendship. The mechanics are simple but engaging, and I feel a sense of joy just imagining players exploring it.  

10:00  
Malik: Beautiful. That sense of joy and discovery is a powerful motivator. How might you use that image to reignite your creative energy?  
Sam: I think I could keep that feeling in mind as a core for my project. Reminding myself of why I started and what I want players to feel might help me move past the block.  
Malik: That’s a strong anchoring technique. Now, let’s look at your goals. You mentioned wanting to find a new creative direction and stabilize income. How are you progressing on that front?  
Sam: I’ve been applying to some grants and trying to pitch smaller projects, but nothing has stuck yet. It’s frustrating, but I’m trying to stay open to different possibilities.  

10:10  
Malik: That’s a resilient approach. Sometimes, the path to stability involves multiple small steps. Reflecting on your strengths, how can you leverage your technical skills and self-taught background to open new doors?  
Sam: Maybe I can create a demo or prototype that showcases my unique style and skills. Sharing that on platforms like itch.io or social media might attract some attention.  
Malik: Excellent idea. Building a portfolio piece that highlights what makes you unique can be a powerful way to attract support and opportunities.  

10:20  
Malik: As we wrap up today, what are the key action items you want to focus on before our next session?  
Sam: I’ll reach out to my open-source contacts and join a couple of developer communities online. I’ll also work on a quick prototype based on the visualization I did today, to keep that inspiration alive.  
Malik: Perfect. And remember to reflect on the stories you tell yourself about independence and resilience. We’ll explore that further next time. Any final thoughts or questions?  
Sam: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Malik. I feel a bit more hopeful already.  
Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Sam. I look forward to hearing about your progress. Have a great week ahead.
