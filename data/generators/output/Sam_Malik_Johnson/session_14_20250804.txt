Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. It’s great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
Sam: Hey, Malik. Honestly, I’ve been a bit overwhelmed, but I’m glad to be here. I’ve been thinking a lot about my creative block lately. It’s like I hit a wall, and I’m not sure how to get past it.  
Malik: That sounds tough. It’s completely normal to feel stuck sometimes—especially after everything you’ve been through recently. Last time, you mentioned feeling disconnected from your original motivation. Do you want to start by sharing what’s been on your mind this week?  
Sam: Yeah. I’ve been working on a new game concept, but every time I sit down, I just stare at the screen and nothing comes. It’s like my ideas froze. I also feel lonely without my co-founder around. It’s like part of my creative energy is missing.  
Malik: I hear you. Creativity often flows within a supportive environment, and losing that partnership can feel like losing part of your momentum. Have you noticed any moments when you did feel inspired or energized recently?  
Sam: Actually, yes. I watched a documentary about indie developers who built their communities around shared stories. That kind of sparked a little fire in me—reminded me why I started this journey.  
Malik: That’s a powerful insight. It sounds like connection and shared storytelling are important to your creative process. Would you say that feeling part of a community or support network might help reignite your energy?  
Sam: Definitely. I think I’ve been so caught up in the solo grind that I forgot how much I thrive when I’m part of something bigger.  
Malik: That’s a valuable realization. From your previous reflection journals, you mentioned wanting to build a support network. How has that been going?  
Sam: Honestly, I’ve just been thinking about it. I haven't actively reached out yet, but I want to. Maybe some online forums or local meetups.  
Malik: That’s a great start. Building connections can provide both emotional support and creative inspiration. Let’s consider a small step—perhaps identifying a few communities or groups aligned with your interests. Would you like me to help you map out some options?  
Sam: Yeah, that would be helpful. Also, I want to explore how to stay motivated when I hit these creative blocks. It feels like I keep cycling back to the same place.  
Malik: Absolutely. One technique we can use is creative visualization—imagine yourself working through a block and coming out the other side. What do you see or feel in that scenario?  
Sam: Hmm. I see myself sketching ideas with a lot of enthusiasm, maybe sharing sketches with a community, getting feedback, and feeling excited again. It’s like reconnecting with my original spark.  
Malik: That’s a powerful image. Connecting with your passion visually can serve as a beacon when you’re feeling stuck. How might you incorporate this visualization into your routine?  
Sam: I think I could set aside a few minutes each day to imagine that process—kind of like a mental rehearsal. Maybe even journal about what that feels like.  
Malik: Excellent. Daily visualization can reinforce your motivation and help reframe your mindset. Let’s also revisit your strengths. Last time, you mentioned your resilience and technical skills. How do those strengths show up in your work right now?  
Sam: Well, I’ve been able to push through some tough coding issues, even when I felt like giving up. Resilience has definitely been a key for me.  
Malik: That’s a great strength to lean on. Sometimes, reframing challenges as opportunities to apply your resilience can shift your perspective. Have you thought about framing your current situation as a hero’s journey—facing a challenge, overcoming it, and emerging stronger?  
Sam: I like that idea. It makes me see my struggles as part of a story—not just random setbacks.  
Malik: Exactly. Your narrative can become a source of motivation. Now, looking ahead, what’s one small actionable step you want to focus on before our next session?  
Sam: I’ll reach out to at least two online communities or meetup groups this week. And I’ll try the daily visualization exercise.  
Malik: Perfect. Those are concrete steps that can help rebuild your support network and reignite your creativity. For next time, we can review how that went and explore any new insights or obstacles. Does that sound good?  
Sam: Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks, Malik. I already feel a bit more hopeful just talking about it.  
Malik: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is often made through small, intentional steps. You’re doing great, Sam. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next week.  
Sam: Thanks. See you then.  
Malik: Take care, Sam.
