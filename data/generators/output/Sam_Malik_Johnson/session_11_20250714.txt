Session 11/24
Date: July 14, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
[09:00]  

Sam: Hey Malik. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel more motivated, but other days I hit that creative wall again. It's frustrating.  
[09:03]  

Malik: I hear you. That ebb and flow is pretty common, especially when navigating creative projects and uncertainties. Let's start by checking in—what stood out for you since we last spoke? Any particular moments or insights?  
[09:07]  

Sam: Well, I did try to revisit some of my old game ideas, and I realized I was avoiding some of the more experimental concepts I used to love. I think I’m afraid they won’t be commercially viable. That fear kind of holds me back.  
[09:10]  

Malik: That’s a valuable observation. It sounds like there's a part of you craving creative freedom but also a part worried about the practical side—money, reception, success. Would you say that’s accurate?  
[09:13]  

Sam: Yeah, exactly. I want to explore new directions, but I keep thinking about what will sell or what others might expect from me, especially after the co-founder split. It feels like I lost a lot of that confidence.  
[09:16]  

Malik: That makes sense. Losing a partner can shake your sense of direction and confidence. Let’s think of this as a hero’s journey—you’re at a moment of transition, facing some internal monsters like doubt and fear of failure. Can you tell me about a time in your life when you faced a challenge and managed to find your way through?  
[09:20]  

Sam: Hmm. There was a time when I was stuck on a project, feeling like I wasn’t making any progress. I ended up stepping back, reflecting, and then I found a new angle that made everything click. I guess I’ve had moments of breakthrough before.  
[09:24]  

Malik: That’s a powerful story of resilience. It shows that even in tough moments, you have the capacity to reflect and pivot. How can you apply that same resilience now? Are there specific steps you can take to reconnect with your creative energy?  
[09:27]  

Sam: I think I need to give myself permission to experiment without worrying about the outcome—like doing some “creative play” just for fun. Also, maybe reaching out to some fellow developers for support or feedback.  
[09:30]  

Malik: Those sound like great strategies. Permission to experiment aligns with embracing your creative process authentically. And building your support network can help reduce that loneliness and provide fresh perspectives. Let’s map out some concrete actions. First, what’s one small experiment you could try this week?  
[09:33]  

Sam: I could set aside an hour daily to just brainstorm and sketch out wild ideas without judging them. No pressure, just free-flowing creativity.  
[09:36]  

Malik: I love that. An hour a day of “creative play” can really reignite your passion. And about support—who can you reach out to? Perhaps a fellow developer or someone from your open-source community?  
[09:39]  

Sam: Yeah, I’ve been meaning to reconnect with Alex, a friend I met at a conference. He’s into experimental game design too, so I think he’d be open to bouncing ideas.  
[09:42]  

Malik: Perfect. Reaching out to Alex could be a great step. How about framing that as a mutual creative check-in—sharing your experiments and getting feedback? And I also suggest keeping a digital reflection journal to track your ideas and feelings throughout the week.  
[09:45]  

Sam: That sounds helpful. I’ve been meaning to get back into journaling, but I kept postponing it. Maybe this time I’ll commit to it.  
[09:48]  

Malik: Excellent. Reflection can deepen your awareness of what energizes you and where you’re encountering blocks. Now, looking ahead, what’s your overall intention for the next month?  
[09:52]  

Sam: My goal is to rediscover my creative spark, build a small support network, and hopefully come up with a new project idea that excites me. I want to feel more confident about what I’m doing.  
[09:55]  

Malik: That’s a clear and inspiring intention. Remember, this journey is about progress, not perfection. Keep honoring your creative process, and celebrate the small wins. For next time, I’d love for you to try your daily brainstorm sessions and reach out to Alex. Also, bring any sketches or ideas you generate. How does that sound?  
[09:59]  

Sam: Sounds good, Malik. I feel more hopeful already—like I have some direction again. Thanks for the support.  
[10:01]  

Malik: You’re very welcome, Sam. I’m proud of your openness and willingness to explore. Let’s check in next week on how your experiments and connections are going. Have a creative and energizing week ahead!  
[10:04]  

Sam: Thanks, Malik. Looking forward to it. Have a great day!  
[10:06]  

Malik: You too. Take care!
