Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or notable you want to share?  

Sam: Morning, Malik. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been feeling more stuck than usual, especially with the creative block. But I did try to revisit some of the visualization exercises we did last time, and I think I made a tiny bit of progress.  

Malik Johnson: That’s good to hear, even if it’s just a small step. Sometimes, progress is like planting seeds—you don’t see the growth right away. Can you tell me more about what that visualization looked like for you this week?  

Sam: Yeah, I tried imagining myself in a space where I feel fully aligned with my work, like I was in a cozy studio, surrounded by my projects. It felt calming, but then I’d get stuck on how to actually get there. The creative energy just isn’t flowing as easily as before.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a common experience, especially when facing creative fatigue. Let’s explore that space you visualized—what qualities or feelings did you notice in that environment?  

Sam: Hmm, it felt peaceful, inspiring, like I had all the time in the world. I also noticed a sense of purpose, like I was doing something meaningful. But then, the reality check hits—how do I create that space in my current situation?  

Malik Johnson: That’s a powerful insight—connecting the feelings of purpose and peace to your ideal environment. It seems like that space represents what you value most in your work. Would you say that clarity helps you understand what’s missing or what you’re striving for?  

Sam: Yeah, definitely. I think I’ve been trying to chase new ideas without really grounding myself in what I truly want. That’s part of why I feel so disconnected lately.  

Malik Johnson: That’s very insightful, Sam. Perhaps we can frame your current challenge as a story—your story of creative pursuit and finding your next chapter. Have you thought about what the hero’s journey might look like for you right now?  

Sam: Not really. I guess I’ve felt like I’m in a bit of a limbo, not quite the hero ready for the next big quest. More like stuck in the woods, not knowing which way to go.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a common phase in the hero’s journey—being in the wilderness, uncertain but still on a path. If we think of your story, what would be the “call to adventure” that might re-ignite your motivation?  

Sam: Maybe it’s reconnecting with why I started game development in the first place—my passion for storytelling and creating worlds. I’ve lost sight of that with all the stress and the split with my co-founder.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a strong foundation. Reconnecting with your original “call” can serve as a compass. How might you integrate that passion into your current projects or future goals?  

Sam: I suppose I could try to revisit some of my earlier prototypes, maybe even share them with a small community or online forum. Getting feedback might help me feel less isolated and more connected.  

Malik Johnson: Excellent idea. Building a small support network around your work can provide encouragement and fresh perspectives. Have you thought about specific groups or platforms that align with your interests?  

Sam: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about joining a few indie dev communities on Discord or Reddit. Also, I follow some YouTubers who do game dev critiques. Maybe I could start sharing my work there.  

Malik Johnson: Great steps. Sharing your projects can also reinforce your sense of purpose and remind you of your strengths. Speaking of strengths, I remember from our earlier sessions that you’re very skilled at technical aspects and storytelling. How do you see these strengths playing into your next phase?  

Sam: I think I’ve been mainly focusing on the tech side, trying to get my game engine running smoothly. But I haven’t really embraced my storytelling voice lately. Maybe I should push myself to write out a storyline or concept art for a new project.  

Malik Johnson: That sounds promising. Incorporating storytelling into your development process can make your projects more authentic and fulfilling. How about setting a small creative goal for the coming week?  

Sam: Maybe I’ll spend an hour each day sketching out story ideas or character backgrounds. And I’ll try to post at least one piece of work in an online community.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a solid plan. Remember, small consistent actions often lead to meaningful change. As you do this, keep reflecting on how these activities make you feel—whether they spark that sense of purpose or bring up new challenges.  

Sam: Will do. I think reconnecting with my original passion and sharing more might help me feel less alone in this process.  

Malik Johnson: Absolutely. And in our next session, we can explore how these actions are affecting your motivation and whether they’re helping you find a clearer direction. Before we wrap up today, are there any other thoughts or feelings you want to acknowledge?  

Sam: Just that I feel a bit nervous about putting my work out there, but also hopeful that it’ll help me get unstuck.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a very honest and brave reflection, Sam. Nerves are natural, especially when stepping into vulnerability. Your willingness to try and share is already a step toward growth.  

Sam: Thanks, Malik. I appreciate the support.  

Malik Johnson: You’re welcome. So, to summarize our action plan: you’ll dedicate time to sketching out story ideas, share at least one piece of work online, and reflect on how these activities impact your sense of purpose. Does that sound good?  

Sam: Yes, that works. I’ll get started on that.  

Malik Johnson: Excellent. Looking forward to hearing how it goes next week. Have a great day, Sam.  

Sam: Thanks, Malik. You too. (smiles)
