Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

**[09:00] Malik:** Good morning, Sam. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable shifts or moments you want to share?  

**[09:03] Sam:** Hey Malik. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling more scattered than usual, especially with the project I was working on. I hit a real creative wall last week, and it’s been tough to get back into the flow.  

**[09:05] Malik:** That sounds challenging. Creative blocks can be really draining, especially when you’re already navigating so much uncertainty about your income and support network. Do you recall what might have triggered that block? Was it related to the project itself or external factors?  

**[09:08] Sam:** I think it’s a mix. Part of it is feeling isolated after splitting with my co-founder. It’s like I lost my main collaborator and a big part of my motivation. Plus, I’ve been questioning whether I should pivot to a new game idea or stick with what I have.  

**[09:10] Malik:** That’s a very human experience—losing a key collaborator can shake your confidence and spark those questions about direction. Let’s try to reframe that moment. How might you view this phase as a story of resilience? Like, what strengths have you demonstrated so far in navigating this?  

**[09:13] Sam:** Hmm… I guess I’ve been pretty persistent. Even after the split, I kept working on my prototypes, trying to stay creative despite the setbacks. I also reached out to some fellow devs online, so I’m trying to build a support network.  

**[09:15] Malik:** That’s excellent. Persistence and outreach are powerful strengths. When you think about the story you’re telling yourself—about yourself as a developer—how does that narrative look, especially in light of these recent challenges?  

**[09:18] Sam:** I’d say I see myself as someone resilient, but also a bit lost right now. Like I’m trying to find a new purpose or direction, but I’m not sure what that looks like yet. Sometimes I wonder if I should just give up on the dream of making a big hit or stick with indie for good.  

**[09:20] Malik:** That’s a very honest reflection. It’s normal to feel torn when facing uncertainty. Let’s explore your core values—what matters most to you in this journey? If you imagine your ideal creative life, what elements are non-negotiable?  

**[09:23] Sam:** I think freedom is huge—being able to experiment and not be tied down by big publishers or studios. I also want to create games that mean something to me, not just for profit but to tell stories I care about.  

**[09:25] Malik:** Those are powerful values—freedom and meaningful storytelling. How can we incorporate these more intentionally into your current projects or plans? Are there ways to align your work more closely with these values?  

**[09:28] Sam:** Maybe I could focus on smaller, experimental projects that I can finish quickly and share with a community. That way, I keep the creative freedom and also get feedback, which might help with motivation.  

**[09:30] Malik:** That sounds like a strong strategy. Smaller projects can serve as creative experiments and help rebuild your confidence. Have you thought about creating a “hero’s journey” map for yourself—visualizing your current story arc and potential next chapters?  

**[09:33] Sam:** Not in detail, no. But I like the idea of framing this as a story. It makes it feel more manageable, like I’m a hero in my own narrative, overcoming obstacles.  

**[09:35] Malik:** Exactly. We can craft a visual hero’s journey map that highlights your challenges, strengths, allies, and new opportunities. Would you like to do that today?  

**[09:37] Sam:** Yeah, I think that would help. It might give me a clearer picture of where I am and where I want to go.  

**[09:40] Malik:** Great. We’ll set that up after this, and I’ll guide you through mapping your current phase and the next steps. Before we do that, let’s talk about your support network. You mentioned reaching out online—who else could be part of your support circle?  

**[09:43] Sam:** Well, I’ve connected with a few indie devs on Discord and Reddit. I also have a couple of friends who are artists and musicians. But I haven’t really formalized that support, and I don’t want to feel like I’m doing this all alone.  

**[09:45] Malik:** Building a more intentional support network can make a big difference. Perhaps setting up regular check-ins with a few trusted peers or mentors could help you feel more connected. Would that be something you’re open to?  

**[09:48] Sam:** Yeah, I think I could try that. Having some accountability might motivate me more and help with the feelings of loneliness.  

**[09:50] Malik:** Excellent. For next steps, let’s focus on three key areas:  
1. Complete your hero’s journey map today to visualize your story arc.  
2. Identify and reach out to at least two members of your support network for regular check-ins.  
3. Define a small, experimental project aligned with your core values to start working on this week.  

Does that sound manageable?  

**[09:53] Sam:** Yes, that feels doable. I like having a clear plan.  

**[09:55] Malik:** Wonderful. I’ll send you a template for the hero’s journey map and some reflection prompts. We’ll review your progress in our next session. Before we finish today, how are you feeling about your creative energy and motivation?  

**[09:58] Sam:** Slightly more hopeful. Talking through this helped me see that I have strengths and options I wasn’t fully recognizing. I still have doubts, but I feel more grounded.  

**[10:00] Malik:** That’s a great place to be. Remember, your story is still unfolding, and you have the tools to shape it intentionally. I look forward to seeing your hero’s journey map next time. Also, check in on your support network and your small project.  

Thanks for sharing so openly today, Sam. I’ll follow up with those materials, and we’ll keep building from here.  

**[10:02] Sam:** Thanks, Malik. I appreciate the support. Talk soon.
