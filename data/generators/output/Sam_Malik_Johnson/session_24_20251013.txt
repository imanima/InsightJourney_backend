Session 24/24
Date: October 13, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Sam: Hey, Malik. Thanks. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling pretty stuck creatively, but I did manage to do some reflection on the stories I was telling myself about my work.  

09:10  
Malik: That’s a strong start. Reflection often uncovers some of those underlying narratives. Do you want to share what came up during that process?  
Sam: Sure. I realized I’ve been telling myself that I’m only successful if I finish a big, blockbuster game—something that would make my name. But I also noticed I’ve been feeling more burnt out trying to chase that vision.  

09:20  
Malik: That’s quite insightful. It sounds like you’re holding onto a story of success that might be limiting your creative energy. How does that story serve you, and how might it be holding you back?  
Sam: Well, it motivates me to push harder, but at the same time, I feel exhausted, and I start questioning if I even enjoy the process anymore. It’s like I’ve lost sight of why I started making games in the first place.  

09:30  
Malik: That’s a common tension—motivation versus burnout. When you think back to why you began this journey, what was the core story or purpose you wanted to live out?  
Sam: I remember wanting to create experiences that make people feel something, like I did when I played certain games that really resonated with me. I wanted to share my perspective and connect with others through my work.  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a powerful story—your desire to connect and inspire. How might you reframe your current creative process to align more with that original purpose?  
Sam: Maybe I’ve been focusing too much on the end product and not enough on the process of expressing myself. Like, I could try to enjoy the small wins in each phase instead of only waiting for the big finish.  

09:50  
Malik: Exactly. Celebrating those smaller, meaningful moments can help rebuild your creative energy. Let’s explore some ways to incorporate that into your routine. Do you have a current project or idea that feels manageable for this purpose?  
Sam: Yeah, I’ve been working on a smaller experimental game about community and connection. It’s not huge, but it’s something I can finish without the pressure of a massive release.  

10:00  
Malik: That sounds like a great opportunity to focus on the storytelling aspect and your purpose. How does working on this smaller project feel compared to your previous big ambitions?  
Sam: Honestly, it feels less overwhelming, and I feel more in control. Like I can experiment without risking everything. But I worry about how to keep motivated when I’m not chasing a big goal.  

10:10  
Malik: Motivation often fluctuates, especially when we shift focus. Let’s think about what intrinsic rewards you can set for this project—things that connect to your core purpose. For example, maybe sharing progress on social media or with your network?  
Sam: Yeah, I could do that. I’ve been hesitant to share too much because I’m afraid of criticism, but maybe focusing on the process rather than perfection could help.  

10:20  
Malik: That’s a valuable insight. Sharing your journey can build support and remind you of your initial passion. How about creating a small support network—maybe other indie developers or friends who understand the creative process?  
Sam: I’ve thought about that. I follow some forums and Discord groups, but I haven’t actively reached out. I guess I’ve been worried about being vulnerable or judged.  

10:30  
Malik: Vulnerability can be tough, but it’s also a way to build authentic connections. Perhaps start by sharing small updates or questions within those groups. Over time, those interactions can become a source of encouragement and feedback.  
Sam: That makes sense. I think I can try that. It might help me feel less isolated, especially after splitting with my co-founder.  

10:40  
Malik: Absolutely. Rebuilding your support network is a key step. Also, reflecting on your strengths—what unique skills or perspectives you bring—can reinforce your confidence. What do you see as your biggest strength as a developer?  
Sam: I think my ability to learn quickly and adapt has helped me get this far. Plus, I really enjoy storytelling, even if I sometimes doubt my skills.  

10:50  
Malik: Those are powerful strengths—adaptability and storytelling. How might you leverage them more intentionally in your current projects?  
Sam: Maybe I can experiment more with narrative-driven prototypes, using my storytelling skills to create engaging experiences without needing huge budgets. That could also make sharing my work easier and more authentic.  

11:00  
Malik: That’s a great idea. It aligns with your purpose and reduces pressure. As we wrap up today, let’s set some action steps. What’s one thing you’ll focus on before our next session?  
Sam: I’ll reach out to at least one group or individual in my network to share my progress and get feedback. I’ll also try to celebrate small wins in my current project.  

11:10  
Malik: Excellent. And remember, reconnecting with your original purpose and building your support network can be ongoing themes. How does that feel?  
Sam: Good. I feel a bit more grounded, and I appreciate having a clear next step. Thanks, Malik.  

11:20  
Malik: You're welcome, Sam. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Keep celebrating your strengths and stay connected to your purpose. Have a great week!  
Sam: Thanks, Malik. You too.
