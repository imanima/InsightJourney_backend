Session 18/24
Date: September 01, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 Malik: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

09:05 Sam: Hey, Malik. Honestly, a bit mixed. I've been feeling stuck creatively, but I did try out some of the visualization exercises you suggested last time. That helped me get a bit clearer on what I want next.

09:10 Malik: That’s good to hear. Visualization can be powerful. Can you tell me more about what you visualized and what came up for you?

09:15 Sam: I saw myself working on a new game, but it was different from my usual projects—more experimental, maybe more narrative-driven. I felt excited but also a little anxious, like I was stepping into uncharted territory.

09:20 Malik: That’s interesting. It sounds like you’re starting to tap into a new creative direction. When you say ‘excited and anxious,’ what does that feeling look like for you? Can you describe it?

09:25 Sam: Yeah, it's like this buzz in my chest, a mix of adrenaline and fear—like I’m on the edge of something big but unsure if I’ll succeed. It’s familiar but also new for me because I usually stick to safer ideas.

09:30 Malik: That’s a common experience when we’re pushing into growth. It’s promising that you’re noticing these feelings. Looking back at our previous sessions, we explored some of the stories you tell yourself about your creative process. How do you feel those stories have shifted, if at all?

09:35 Sam: Hmm, I think I’ve started to see my creativity more as a journey rather than a flickering flame that’s easy to lose. In past sessions, we discussed framing setbacks as part of the hero’s journey. That perspective has helped me be more forgiving of myself.

09:40 Malik: That’s a powerful shift. Seeing setbacks as part of a larger narrative can change how we approach challenges. Speaking of which, are there specific ‘villains’ or obstacles in your story right now that you’re facing?

09:45 Sam: Yeah, definitely. The biggest one is feeling isolated—after splitting with my co-founder, I lost my main support and collaborator. It’s hard to stay motivated alone, especially when financial stress adds to it.

09:50 Malik: That sense of isolation can really weigh on your creative energy. When you think of your story, who or what is the ‘mentor’ or source of guidance that you might be overlooking?

09:55 Sam: Hmm... I guess I haven't really thought about mentors in a while. I used to look to some YouTubers and open-source communities for inspiration, but I haven’t actively reached out to anyone lately.

10:00 Malik: Reconnecting with those communities or finding new mentors could be a vital step. Sometimes, the hero’s journey involves seeking allies. Do you feel ready to explore ways to rebuild your support network?

10:05 Sam: Yeah, I think so. I realize I’ve been relying too much on myself. Maybe I can join some online game dev groups or forums—try to find people who understand what I’m going through.

10:10 Malik: That sounds like a solid plan. Building those connections can boost your resilience. Now, regarding your creative process, you mentioned feeling blocked. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that lead to these blocks?

10:15 Sam: Often, I get overwhelmed by all the ideas I have. I start thinking I won’t do any of them justice, so I end up procrastinating or avoiding altogether. It’s like I get paralyzed by the options.

10:20 Malik: That’s a common challenge. Sometimes, narrowing focus helps. Have you considered creating a ‘storyboard’ or a narrative outline for one project, to give yourself a clear starting point?

10:25 Sam: Not really, but I like the idea. Maybe if I mapped out a simple hero’s journey for a new game concept, I could clarify my direction and reduce that overwhelm.

10:30 Malik: Excellent. Using narrative structures like the hero’s journey can serve as a blueprint. Would you like to try sketching a quick outline now, or perhaps as homework before our next session?

10:35 Sam: I think I’ll try drafting an outline this week. That way, I can see if it sparks ideas or helps me feel more grounded.

10:40 Malik: Perfect. Moving forward, let’s also look at resource mapping. Do you feel confident about what tools or resources you currently have that can support this new direction?

10:45 Sam: Well, I have my coding skills, some open-source assets, and a few game engines I’m comfortable with. But I’m not sure how to leverage AI tools for storytelling or design.

10:50 Malik: Using AI storytelling tools could help you generate narrative ideas or even prototype components. Would you be interested in exploring some specific tools together in our next session?

10:55 Sam: Yeah, that sounds helpful. I’ve heard about a few but haven’t really dived in yet.

11:00 Malik: Great. To summarize, your action items are: 1) Reach out to at least one online game dev community or forum this week. 2) Draft a simple narrative outline using the hero’s journey framework for your new game idea. 3) Explore AI storytelling tools and prepare any questions or insights for our next session.

11:05 Sam: Got it. Thanks, Malik. I feel more focused already.

11:10 Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Sam. Remember, this is a journey, and each step forward is progress. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Before we finish, do you have any questions or anything else you'd like to share?

11:15 Sam: Not right now. Just feeling optimistic, which is a good change.

11:20 Malik: Wonderful. Keep that optimism alive, and I’ll see you next week. Take care, Sam.

11:25 Sam: Thanks, Malik. Bye.

11:30 Malik: Bye.
