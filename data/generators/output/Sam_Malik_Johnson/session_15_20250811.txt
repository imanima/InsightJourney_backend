Session 15/24
Date: August 11, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
[09:00]

Sam: Hey Malik, thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel really stuck, but I’ve also had moments where I catch a glimpse of a new idea that excites me.  

Malik: That’s quite common in the creative process—those highs and lows. Last time, we talked about feeling a bit lost after splitting with your co-founder. How have you been managing those feelings?  
[09:05]

Sam: I think I’ve been trying to stay busy, you know? Working on some small projects here and there, but I haven’t really found that spark again. It’s like I’m searching for a new story to tell, but I don’t know what it is yet.  

Malik: That’s a powerful metaphor—searching for a story. Remember how we used the hero’s journey map last time? Have you noticed any new themes or ideas emerging since then?  
[09:10]

Sam: Actually, yes. I started thinking about the idea of transformation—how I can turn this setback into something new. Like, maybe this is a chance to reinvent myself, not just as a developer but as a storyteller.  

Malik: That’s a strong narrative shift. Reframing the setback as a transformation aligns with your resilience. How does that feel internally? Do you notice any shifts in your motivation or energy?  
[09:15]

Sam: It’s a bit motivating, honestly. It helps me see that even though I’m in a tough spot, I can use that experience as fuel. But at the same time, I worry about losing focus or getting overwhelmed by all the possibilities.  

Malik: That’s understandable. The creative mind can be a labyrinth. Let’s try a visualization exercise now—imagine yourself in the future, having successfully navigated this phase. What does that look like?  
[09:20]

Sam: (closes eyes briefly) I see myself working on a project that combines AI and storytelling—a game that feels meaningful and innovative. I’m collaborating with a small team, feeling connected and supported. And I’ve started sharing my journey online, connecting with other developers.  

Malik: That’s a vivid picture. How does it feel to see yourself there?  
[09:25]

Sam: It feels good, like I can see a purpose again. Like I’m heading toward something that matters to me. But I also wonder how to get from here to there without burning out.  

Malik: That’s a valid concern. Let’s explore some practical steps. From your current position, what resources or support could help you move toward this vision? Think about skills, connections, or tools.  
[09:30]

Sam: Well, I’ve been contributing to open-source projects, so maybe reconnecting with some of those communities could help me find collaborators. Also, I have a couple of contacts I met at a recent game dev meetup. I could reach out to them.  

Malik: Excellent. Building that support network is key. How about your creative process—are there routines or practices you could establish to foster inspiration and focus?  
[09:35]

Sam: I think I need to set dedicated times for deep work—maybe blocks of two or three hours without distractions. Also, I’ve been thinking about doing daily journaling, just to track ideas and feelings.  

Malik: Those are solid strategies. Daily journaling can help you process your thoughts and spot emerging themes. Remember, it’s about consistency, not perfection. How confident do you feel about implementing these practices?  
[09:40]

Sam: I feel optimistic about trying them. It’s just about making it a habit, I guess. I’m also considering using some AI tools to brainstorm story ideas—kind of like a creative partner.  

Malik: That’s a smart move—leveraging technology to augment your creativity. How do you see that fitting into your overall plan?  
[09:45]

Sam: I think it can help me get unstuck when I hit those creative blocks. Plus, it might inspire new directions I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. I want to experiment with it and see where it takes me.  

Malik: Perfect. So, to sum up, your action steps are: reconnect with your open-source community, reach out to your contacts from the meetup, establish a daily journaling routine, and experiment with AI brainstorming tools. Sound good?  
[09:50]

Sam: Yeah, that sounds achievable. I’m feeling more hopeful now, like I have a plan to move forward.  

Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, this journey isn’t linear—there will be twists and turns. Keep framing your story as one of resilience and growth. Before we end, what’s one thing you’ll do this week to reinforce this new narrative?  
[09:55]

Sam: I’ll reach out to my contacts and schedule a brainstorming session with some of the open-source folks. And I’ll start my journaling tonight.  

Malik: Excellent. I look forward to hearing how that goes. Next session, we’ll check in on these steps and explore any new insights. Keep nurturing your story, Sam. You’re making meaningful progress.  
[09:58]

Sam: Thanks, Malik. I appreciate your support. See you next week.
