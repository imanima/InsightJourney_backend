Session 20/24
Date: September 15, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
[09:00]

Sam: Hey, Malik. Thanks for asking. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling some creative fatigue, but I also had a small breakthrough with a new game concept I’ve been working on.  
[09:05]

Malik: That’s promising to hear—those breakthroughs can be really energizing. Can you tell me more about this new concept? What sparked it?  
[09:07]

Sam: Well, I was feeling stuck on my current project—my main game idea was just not flowing. So I took a step back, did some free writing about what I’d love to explore if I had no limits. And suddenly, a new story universe started forming—more personal, more experimental. It’s like I rediscovered my passion for storytelling again.  
[09:10]

Malik: That’s a wonderful example of creative renewal—sometimes, stepping back and reconnecting with what excites us can reignite that spark. How does this new universe align with your core values or the kind of impact you want your games to have?  
[09:15]

Sam: I think it’s about authenticity and exploration. I want my games to reflect genuine stories, maybe even challenge players to think differently. It feels more meaningful than just chasing commercial success.  
[09:17]

Malik: That’s a powerful insight. It sounds like you’re moving toward a purpose that emphasizes authenticity and personal expression. How does that compare or contrast with your previous projects?  
[09:20]

Sam: My earlier work was more about fitting into trends or trying to get noticed. But that often left me feeling disconnected, like I was playing a role rather than being true to myself. This new direction feels more aligned with who I am.  
[09:22]

Malik: That’s a significant shift—honoring your authentic voice. Now, earlier we discussed your feelings of loneliness after splitting with your co-founder. How are you managing those feelings now?  
[09:25]

Sam: It’s still there, honestly. I miss having that creative partnership, someone to bounce ideas off. But I’ve started reaching out to a few fellow developers and attending online meetups, which helps a bit.  
[09:28]

Malik: That’s great progress—building a support network can be vital, especially in independent work. How do you feel about your current support system overall?  
[09:30]

Sam: It’s growing, but it’s not quite at the level I’d like. I still feel a little isolated sometimes, especially when I hit blocks. I guess I need more consistent connection.  
[09:32]

Malik: That’s understandable. Let’s explore some ways you might deepen those connections—maybe through collaborative projects or shared creative spaces?  
[09:35]

Sam: Yeah, I like that idea. Maybe I could organize a small virtual game jam or join a community of indie developers. That might help me feel more connected and motivated.  
[09:38]

Malik: Excellent. Now, regarding your creative blocks—what specific triggers tend to cause them? Are they related to technical challenges, self-doubt, or something else?  
[09:40]

Sam: Mostly self-doubt. I worry that my ideas aren’t good enough or that I’ll never make a game that resonates. Sometimes, I get overwhelmed with all the possibilities and don’t know where to start.  
[09:43]

Malik: That’s a common experience among creative entrepreneurs. Have you tried any particular techniques to manage that uncertainty?  
[09:45]

Sam: I’ve done some journaling and visualization exercises, imagining myself successfully finishing a project. It helps sometimes, but the doubts still creep in.  
[09:48]

Malik: Visualization can be powerful. Let’s tap into that today—imagine your ideal project from start to finish. How does it feel? What’s the story you’re telling, and who are you as the creator?  
[09:50]

Sam: (closes eyes briefly) I see myself working on a game that combines narrative depth with innovative mechanics—maybe something that encourages players to reflect on their own stories. I feel proud and excited when I think about it.  
[09:55]

Malik: That’s a beautiful vision. How might you begin to bring elements of this into your current work? Are there small steps you can take today?  
[09:57]

Sam: Maybe I can sketch out a rough outline or write a short narrative scene inspired by that universe. Just to get the ball rolling.  
[10:00]

Malik: Perfect. Small, manageable steps often lead to meaningful progress. As we look ahead, what’s one specific goal you want to set for the next week related to your creative process or support network?  
[10:02]

Sam: I’ll reach out to at least two fellow developers—maybe schedule a call or join a community event—and also spend some dedicated time each day brainstorming ideas for this new universe.  
[10:05]

Malik: That sounds like a solid plan. And how will you celebrate or acknowledge your progress along the way?  
[10:07]

Sam: I think I’ll keep a journal of my ideas and reflections. Maybe even share a piece of my work with someone I trust for feedback. That way, I stay motivated.  
[10:10]

Malik: Excellent. Remember, your story as a creator is unfolding with each step. Before we wrap up, do you want to reflect on any insights from today’s session or anything specific you want to carry forward?  
[10:12]

Sam: Yeah, I feel more hopeful. Reconnecting with my authentic vision feels like the right direction, and I’m glad I’m taking steps to build my support system. It’s reassuring to remember that this is a process.  
[10:15]

Malik: Absolutely. Your resilience and clarity are inspiring. I’ll see you next week, and we can check in on your progress. Any final questions or thoughts?  
[10:18]

Sam: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Malik. Looking forward to next week.  
[10:20]

Malik: Have a great week, Sam. Take care.
