Session 2/24
Date: May 12, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Sam. It’s great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
Sam: Hey, Malik. Honestly, a bit anxious but also hopeful. Last week’s session left me thinking a lot about my creative direction.  

09:10  
Malik: That’s understandable. It’s a big topic, especially when you’re at a crossroads with your projects. Last time, we touched on your feelings of creative stagnation and the sense of loneliness after your co-founder split. How have things been since then?  
Sam: I’ve been trying to push through it. I’ve done some more open-source contributions, which helps a bit, but I still feel kind of stuck. Like I’m not sure which project to focus on next or if I should be exploring new ideas altogether.  

09:20  
Malik: It sounds like you’re in a bit of a creative fog—trying to find that spark again. Do you remember the hero journey map we worked on last time? Maybe revisiting that could help you see your story from a different angle.  
Sam: Yeah, I remember. I suppose I see myself as in the "call to adventure" phase, but I haven’t yet crossed the threshold into the “special world” of new ideas. It’s like I’m hesitating.  

09:30  
Malik: That’s a helpful insight. Sometimes, the hesitation is part of the process—your mind is preparing for transformation. What do you think is holding you back from taking the next step?  
Sam: Fear of failure, mostly. If I try a new direction and it doesn’t work out, I worry about wasting time and losing confidence, especially since my income is unstable right now.  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a very common fear, especially for independent creators. But from a narrative perspective, failure is often just a plot twist—not the end of the story. Can we reframe your fear as part of your hero’s journey? Maybe as a challenge that will make your eventual success more meaningful?  
Sam (nods): Yeah, I like that idea. It’s hard to see failure as part of progress, though. I usually see it as a dead end.  

09:50  
Malik: That’s natural. Let’s try a visualization exercise. Imagine your current project as a mountain you’re climbing. What’s the view like from where you stand now?  
Sam: I see a lot of fog—hard to see the summit clearly. I feel like I’m circling around the base, unsure which path to take.  

10:00  
Malik: Good imagery. Now, if we add a hero archetype—someone resilient, resourceful—what strengths does that hero bring that you can tap into?  
Sam: Hmm… I’d say resilience, definitely. Also, curiosity and technical skills. I’ve learned a lot from my open-source work, and I’m pretty persistent.  

10:10  
Malik: Excellent. These are your guiding lights. How might you use those strengths to navigate through the fog?  
Sam: Maybe by breaking down my project into smaller, manageable pieces. Focus on one feature at a time—like building a map step-by-step rather than rushing to the top.  

10:20  
Malik: That’s a strong strategy. It aligns with your technical skills and perseverance. Do you feel ready to set a small, actionable goal for this week?  
Sam: Yes. I think I’ll outline three mini-projects or features I can work on without feeling overwhelmed. Maybe even share progress in my online community for accountability.  

10:30  
Malik: That sounds very practical. How about also reaching out to one or two colleagues or fellow developers? Building that support network can help reduce the loneliness and provide feedback.  
Sam: Good idea. I’ve been avoiding networking because I felt self-conscious after the split, but I know I need support.  

10:40  
Malik: Absolutely. Remember, building your support network is part of your hero’s journey—forming alliances. It can also help you gain new perspectives and motivation.  
Sam: Yeah, I think I’ll try to reconnect with some old contacts and maybe join a Discord server for indie devs.  

10:50  
Malik: Wonderful. To wrap up today’s session, what’s the main insight or takeaway you’re carrying forward?  
Sam: That failure isn’t the end, but part of the process. I can use my strengths—resilience and curiosity—to take small steps, and I don’t have to do it all alone.  

11:00  
Malik: Beautiful summary. For next week, let’s focus on refining those project ideas and creating a simple plan for reaching out to your support network. Does that sound good?  
Sam: Yes, I feel more hopeful already. Thanks, Malik.  

11:05  
Malik: You’re very welcome, Sam. I’ll send you a reflection journal prompt to explore your story of resilience and some resources for community connections. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next week.  
Sam: Thanks. Have a great week!
