Session 10/24
Date: July 07, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 [Session begins] Malik: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Sam: Hey Malik. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel energized about new ideas, and others I feel stuck and unsure where to focus next.  

09:05 Malik: That sounds familiar, especially with the creative process bouncing around. Last time, we talked about your feelings of loneliness after the co-founder split and your desire to find a clearer direction. Have you noticed anything this week that’s helped or made things more complicated?  
Sam: Yeah, I tried to work on a new prototype that I thought would be exciting, but I hit a wall pretty quickly. It’s like I lost the thread of what I was trying to say with this game. Also, I’ve been streaming more, trying to connect with other developers online. It’s been helpful, but I still feel pretty isolated sometimes.  

09:10 Malik: It’s good you’re reaching out through streaming—that’s a step toward building your support network. Let’s explore that a bit. What does connecting with other developers give you, emotionally or creatively?  
Sam: It’s like a breath of fresh air, honestly. Seeing others’ projects and sharing ideas makes me feel less alone, and sometimes I get inspired by their work. But then, other times, I compare myself and feel like I’m falling behind or not talented enough.  

09:15 Malik: That’s a common experience—comparison can be a double-edged sword. Remember last month, we worked on framing your story as a hero’s journey? How do you see your journey right now? Are you still in the “initial call to adventure,” or do you feel like you’ve entered a new phase?  
Sam: Hmm. I think I’m definitely still in the call to adventure. I’ve started questioning whether I should keep going solo or try to find another co-creator, but I haven’t taken any big steps yet. Sometimes I wonder if I should just give up, but then I think about what I really want—creating meaningful games that matter to me.  

09:20 Malik: That’s a powerful insight—that your underlying purpose still drives you. Let’s revisit your values. You mentioned wanting to create meaningful games; what core values does that reflect for you?  
Sam: Creativity, independence, authenticity—that’s what I care about. I want to tell stories that matter, not just chase trends or make quick money.  

09:25 Malik: Beautiful. Connecting your current work with those values can help you find a clearer direction. Now, thinking about your creative block, have you tried any specific visualization or storytelling techniques since our last session?  
Sam: I’ve done a bit of journaling, trying to visualize my ideal project, but I haven’t been consistent. I also thought about doing a hero’s journey map for my current project, but I haven’t sat down to do it fully.  

09:30 Malik: That's a good start. Visualization can be more effective when you make it a routine. Let’s try a quick exercise now. Close your eyes (pause) and imagine your ideal game project. What’s the story you want to tell? Who are your characters, and what challenges do they face?  
(Sam closes eyes; silence for a few seconds)  
Sam: I see a story about resilience and community—maybe set in a dystopian world where small groups band together to rebuild society. The characters are outcasts, but they find strength in their shared purpose.  

09:35 Malik: That’s a compelling narrative, aligned with your values of authenticity and storytelling. How might you incorporate this vision into your current work?  
Sam: I think I can start designing game mechanics that emphasize cooperation and resilience. Maybe focus less on individual achievement and more on team-based gameplay.  

09:40 Malik: Excellent. That creative shift can reignite your energy and give your project a new purpose. Now, let’s map out some resources—what tools, skills, or connections could support this new direction?  
Sam: Well, I have some contacts in online communities focused on cooperative games. I also want to learn more about multiplayer networking and AI-driven NPCs. As for tools, I use Unity, but I might explore some new plugins for multiplayer features.  

09:45 Malik: Great resourcefulness. How about support? Are there communities or mentors you can tap into for feedback or collaboration?  
Sam: I’ve been meaning to join a couple of Discord servers for indie developers, but I haven’t taken the plunge yet. I also want to find a peer group where I can share progress regularly.  

09:50 Malik: That’s a good plan. Building a support network takes time, but it’s crucial. Now, reflecting on your journey so far, what strengths have you noticed in yourself?  
Sam: I think my resilience stands out. Even when I feel stuck, I keep pushing forward. Also, my technical skills—being self-taught—help me adapt and learn new things quickly.  

09:55 Malik: Those are powerful strengths. By framing your resilience and adaptability as part of your hero’s journey, you can see your growth as ongoing. For next steps, what action will you take before our next session?  
Sam: I’ll join those Discord communities, start connecting with other developers, and do a dedicated hero’s journey mapping for my current project. I’ll also schedule a session with a mentor I’ve been meaning to reach out to.  

10:00 Malik: Perfect. Keep track of your experiences and any insights you gain. We’ll review your progress in our next session and continue refining your vision. How does that sound?  
Sam: Sounds good, Malik. Thanks for the clarity and encouragement. It feels good to have some concrete steps.  

10:05 Malik: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, your story is unfolding uniquely, and every step you take adds to your narrative. I look forward to hearing about your progress. See you next week!  
Sam: Thanks, Malik. See you next time.
