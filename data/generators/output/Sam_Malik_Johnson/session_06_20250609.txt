Session 6/24
Date: June 09, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. Glad you could make it today. How have you been since our last session? Any notable shifts or moments you'd like to share?

09:05 Sam: Hey, Malik. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling more aware of the creative blocks I mentioned last time, but also surprisingly more motivated to figure them out. I spent some time reflecting on my last session’s exercise—mapping out my hero’s journey—and I think I see some themes emerging.

09:10 Malik Johnson: That’s great to hear. It’s interesting how revisiting your story can shed new light on your current challenges. Can you tell me more about what themes are coming up for you?

09:15 Sam: Well, I noticed that a recurring theme is resilience—how I’ve navigated setbacks, especially after the co-founder split. I kept thinking about how I’ve had to reframe my story from “failure” to “learning experience.” It’s helped me to see my journey as more of a hero’s quest, with ups and downs.

09:20 Malik Johnson: That’s a powerful realization. Framing setbacks as chapters in your hero’s journey can shift your perspective significantly. How does this new framing influence your motivation or your creative process?

09:25 Sam: It makes me feel a bit more empowered. Like I’m not stuck in one chapter, but still moving forward. I’ve started to see my current projects as new adventures, rather than dead ends. But I do still feel lonely sometimes, especially when I compare myself to other devs with teams or more stable incomes.

09:30 Malik Johnson: That’s completely understandable. Comparing can sometimes overshadow your own progress. Remember, your journey is uniquely yours, and your resilience is a core strength. Have you thought about ways to build a support network that respects your independence but also offers connection?

09:35 Sam: Yeah, I’ve been considering joining some online communities for indie devs. I’ve also thought about reaching out to some former colleagues or mentors, even if just for occasional feedback. But I worry about opening up too much or feeling like I don’t belong.

09:40 Malik Johnson: Those are valid concerns. Building a support network doesn’t mean you have to share everything all at once. It’s about creating a space where you feel safe and valued. Perhaps starting with small, manageable connections—like commenting in forums or joining a local meetup—could gradually help you feel more connected.

09:45 Sam: That makes sense. Starting small feels less overwhelming. I think I also need to clarify what I really want from these connections—like, do I want mentorship, collaboration, or just moral support?

09:50 Malik Johnson: Exactly. Clarifying your needs can guide your outreach efforts. Based on your goals—finding new creative directions and stabilizing income—what kind of support do you think would help most right now?

09:55 Sam: Probably a mix. Some mentorship for skills or business advice, and some peers who understand the indie dev life. I think having people who get the creative and financial uncertainties would make me feel less isolated.

10:00 Malik Johnson: That’s a solid plan. Maybe we can map out a specific outreach strategy together next time, identifying potential communities or individuals. Now, you mentioned feeling creatively blocked—have you noticed when these blocks tend to happen? Are there patterns or triggers?

10:05 Sam: I think they hit hardest when I’m stressed about money or feeling like I’m behind on a project. Sometimes I get stuck trying to perfect a detail, and then I lose momentum.

10:10 Malik Johnson: It sounds like stress and perfectionism are contributing to your blocks. A helpful approach might be to reframe those moments—seeing them as part of the process rather than obstacles. Have you tried any techniques like creative visualization or setting smaller, achievable goals?

10:15 Sam: I’ve started doing some visualization exercises, imagining myself as a confident creator, and it helps a bit. I also broke down my current project into smaller tasks, which makes it feel less daunting.

10:20 Malik Johnson: That’s excellent progress. Breaking projects into smaller steps can really boost your sense of control and motivation. Perhaps next week, we can explore some story or character techniques to spark new ideas—tools that can reignite your creative energy.

10:25 Sam: I’d like that. I feel like I’ve been stuck in my head too much, overthinking everything. Getting some fresh perspectives could be helpful.

10:30 Malik Johnson: Absolutely. Remember, your story is ongoing, and every chapter brings new possibilities. How are you feeling about your overall creative direction right now? Any new insights or shifts?

10:35 Sam: Honestly, I feel a bit more optimistic. Reframing my setbacks as part of a hero’s journey makes me see the bigger picture. I’m starting to believe I can find a new creative path that’s aligned with my values.

10:40 Malik Johnson: That’s inspiring. Your resilience and openness are truly strengths. We’ll continue to build on that foundation. Before we wrap up, what’s one action step you want to focus on before our next session?

10:45 Sam: I’ll reach out to at least two people in online communities or networks I’ve identified, just to start the conversation. Also, I’ll keep working on my project breakdown and visualization exercises.

10:50 Malik Johnson: Excellent. That’s a concrete step towards building your support system and reigniting your creativity. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Any last thoughts or questions before we finish today?

10:55 Sam: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Malik. This session helped me feel more grounded and motivated.

10:56 Malik Johnson: Glad to hear that, Sam. Remember, your story is unfolding, and you’re the hero. See you next week—take care until then.

10:58 Sam: Thanks, Malik. You too.
