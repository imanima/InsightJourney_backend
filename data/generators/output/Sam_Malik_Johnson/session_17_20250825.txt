Session 17/24
Date: August 25, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Sam (Indie Game Developer)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[09:03] Sam: Hey Malik. Honestly, a bit better, I think. I’ve been trying to push through some creative blocks, and I’ve had a few moments where I felt more energized about my projects. But it’s still a rollercoaster.

[09:06] Malik: That’s understandable. Creative work often comes in waves, especially when you're navigating big changes like your split with your co-founder. Last time, we talked about reconnecting with your core passions. Have you had any new insights or moments of clarity about what excites you most right now?

[09:09] Sam: Yeah, actually. I spent some time last week revisiting some old game ideas I shelved. One of them—a story-driven puzzle game—felt really alive again when I thought about it. It kind of reignited my sense of purpose, you know? Like, I might want to focus on narrative-heavy games again.

[09:12] Malik: That’s a strong sign of aligning with your core strengths. You mentioned feeling more energized—what was it about that project that sparked that feeling? Was it the storytelling aspect, the mechanics, or something else?

[09:15] Sam: I think it’s the storytelling. I love crafting worlds and characters, and I miss that deep connection with narrative. It’s where I feel most myself. But I also feel a bit overwhelmed because I’m not sure how to make it financially viable right now.

[09:18] Malik: Those are common concerns, especially after a breakup from a co-founder. Let’s explore that a bit. When you think about your story as a game developer, how would you describe your hero’s journey so far?

[09:21] Sam (smiling faintly): Hmm, I guess I’d say I started as a lone hero, self-taught, navigating the wilds of indie development. I faced a lot of monsters—self-doubt, financial struggles, and loneliness. The split with my co-founder felt like a major boss fight I didn’t quite win, but I survived.

[09:25] Malik: That’s a powerful metaphor. How do you think that boss fight has shaped your current story? Are there lessons or strengths you gained that you can reframe as allies for your next chapter?

[09:28] Sam: I think I’ve become more resilient. I’ve learned to rely on my skills and be adaptable. Also, I’ve realized I don’t have to do everything alone. I’ve started reaching out to some other devs online.

[09:31] Malik: That’s excellent. Building that support network is key. It sounds like you’re moving from isolation toward collaboration. How does that feel, emotionally and practically?

[09:34] Sam: It’s a bit nerve-wracking but also hopeful. I’ve always been pretty independent, but I see the value in connecting with others who understand the grind. It’s reassuring.

[09:37] Malik: That’s a healthy shift. Now, considering your creative energy and the support network you’re building, what small steps can you take in the next week to nurture both your project and your connections?

[09:40] Sam: I could join a couple of indie dev forums more actively, maybe participate in a game jam online. For my project, I’ll try to block out some dedicated time this weekend just for storytelling and world-building.

[09:43] Malik: Those sound like strategic moves. Engaging more actively online can expand your support and opportunities, and dedicated creative time can help break the block. How will you measure progress or notice if these steps are working?

[09:46] Sam: I guess I’ll look for a sense of momentum—feeling less stuck, maybe getting some positive feedback, or even just feeling more connected to my work again.

[09:49] Malik: That’s a great way to track your internal sense of progress. Now, I’d like us to revisit your values. When you think about what matters most to you in your work and life, what surfaces?

[09:52] Sam: Creativity, independence, authenticity, and making a meaningful impact with my stories. I want my games to tell stories that matter, not just chase trends.

[09:55] Malik: Those are powerful guiding principles. How might you align your current projects and support network efforts with these values?

[09:58] Sam: I can focus on projects that feel authentic to me, even if they’re smaller. And I’ll seek collaborators who share similar values, rather than just chasing quick success.

[10:01] Malik: That alignment can give you a sense of purpose and resilience. As we look ahead, what is one thing you want to focus on before our next session?

[10:04] Sam: I want to start drafting some story outlines for that puzzle game idea, and I’ll join at least one dev forum or community.

[10:07] Malik: Excellent. And how will you hold yourself accountable for these actions?

[10:10] Sam: I’ll set specific goals, maybe a small writing target each day, and keep a journal of my progress. I can also check in with a couple of those dev contacts I make.

[10:13] Malik: Perfect. To wrap up, I’d like you to reflect on one strength you’ve used recently that helped you move forward.

[10:16] Sam: I’d say resilience. Even after the split, I kept going, and I’ve found new ways to reconnect with my passion.

[10:19] Malik: That’s a vital strength. Remember to celebrate that resilience as you navigate these next steps. For our next session, we can explore how your narrative can continue to evolve and how to integrate your values more deeply. Does that sound good?

[10:22] Sam: Absolutely. Thanks, Malik. I feel more hopeful and clear about my next move.

[10:25] Malik: I’m glad to hear that. Keep nurturing your creative energy and your support network, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. Have a great week, Sam.

[10:28] Sam: Thanks, Malik. See you next time.

[10:30] Malik: Take care.
