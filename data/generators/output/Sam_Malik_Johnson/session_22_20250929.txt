Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 [Session Start]  
Malik Johnson: Good morning, Sam. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Sam: Hey, Malik. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel energized about my project, but other days I hit a wall and just feel stuck.  

Malik: That’s completely natural, especially given the creative ebbs and flows you’re experiencing. Let’s start by checking in — what’s been the most prominent feeling or thought for you this week?  

Sam: I’d say mostly frustration. I’ve been trying to figure out the next big feature for my game, but I keep doubting if it’s worth pursuing or if I should just take a break altogether.  

Malik: I hear you. Creative doubt can really drain our motivation. Before we dive deeper, do you remember the last time we talked about your core values and what initially drew you to game development?  

Sam: Yeah, we discussed how I love storytelling, creating immersive worlds, and sharing experiences that make people think or feel something. That’s still what drives me.  

Malik: That’s a strong foundation. Sometimes, during creative blocks, reconnecting with your purpose can serve as a compass. Would you like to do a quick visualization exercise to tap into that?  

Sam: Sure, I’m up for it.  

[09:10]  
Malik: Great. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. Picture yourself five years from now—your ideal version as a creator. What are you working on? Who are you collaborating with? How do you feel?  

(Sam closes his eyes, takes deep breaths)  

Sam: I see myself working on a game that combines storytelling with educational elements, maybe something that helps people understand different cultures. I’m collaborating with a diverse team of designers and writers. I feel inspired, purposeful, and connected.  

Malik: That’s a powerful vision. How does that compare to your current projects? Are there elements of that vision you can incorporate now?  

Sam: I think I’ve been so focused on just finishing a game that I forgot about what really excites me—storytelling that educates or enlightens. I’ve been stuck trying to be commercially viable first, but maybe I need to revisit that core idea.  

Malik: Exactly. Reframing your project around your purpose can reignite your motivation. Let’s explore that further—what’s one small step you could take this week toward that vision?  

Sam: Maybe I could start sketching out story concepts that tie into cultural themes I’m passionate about, even if I don’t develop them right away.  

Malik: That sounds like a meaningful step. Now, earlier, you mentioned feeling lonely after splitting with your co-founder. How’s that been affecting your creative process?  

Sam: It’s been tough. I miss bouncing ideas off someone, and sometimes I feel like I’m on my own in this. It’s hard to stay motivated when I’m not sharing the journey.  

Malik: That’s a common challenge. Building a support network is crucial, especially for independent creators. Have you considered reaching out to other developers or joining online communities?  

Sam: I have some contacts, but I haven’t really taken the step to connect more intentionally. I guess I’m worried about feeling vulnerable or not fitting in.  

Malik: Those feelings are understandable. Remember, many others in your field experience similar doubts. Sometimes, sharing your goals and struggles can open doors to support and collaboration. Would you like us to identify some potential communities or networks to explore?  

Sam: Yeah, that would help. I think I’d like to find a community where I can share ideas without judgment.  

[09:25]  
Malik: Excellent. I can help you create a list of online forums, local meetups, or even mentorship programs. Let’s also look at your current resource map—what tools or skills do you have that could support these new connections?  

Sam: Well, I’m pretty good with AI models and open-source tools, and I can contribute to some collaborative projects. I also have a YouTube channel where I share development insights.  

Malik: Those are valuable assets. Sharing your expertise can attract like-minded people and foster support. Perhaps you can start by announcing your interest in connecting on your channel or social media?  

Sam: That’s a good idea. I could make a quick video about what I’m looking for—collaborators, feedback, or just someone to talk shop with.  

Malik: Perfect. It’s about taking small, authentic steps. Now, thinking back to our last sessions, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made in clarifying your purpose and building your support network?  

Sam: I think I’ve made some headway. Rechecking my core values and visualizing my future self really helped me reconnect with why I started this. And even just thinking about reaching out makes me a bit less isolated.  

Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Purpose and support are powerful anchors. Before we wrap up, let’s set a couple of concrete goals for next week.  

Sam: Okay. I’ll sketch out some story ideas inspired by cultural themes and post a message on a developer community site to introduce myself.  

Malik: Those sound like meaningful steps. For our next session, we can review your sketches and discuss any responses you receive. Also, I’ll send you some prompts to deepen your visualization practice.  

Sam: Thanks, Malik. I feel more hopeful today. It helps to have a plan and some new perspectives.  

Malik: I’m glad. Remember, your creative journey is uniquely yours, and every step—even the tough ones—are part of your story. See you next week, Sam.  

Sam: Thanks, Malik. See you next time.
