09:00 [Session begins]  
Malik: Good morning, Omar. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything—academic stress, trying to figure out my next steps, and balancing my personal life. It’s a lot to juggle.  
Malik: I hear you. That’s quite a bit for anyone. Let’s start by checking in on your overall energy and motivation levels. On a scale of 1 to 10, where would you rate your current sense of clarity about your career?  
Omar: Maybe a 4 or 5. I still feel stuck, but I’ve also started to see some small pieces of what I might want.  
Malik: That’s a good sign—small pieces are progress. Last time, we talked about your strengths and how they might influence your career path. Do you recall the strengths assessment we did?  
Omar: Yes, I remember. I identified my curiosity, analytical skills, and my persistence as key strengths.  
Malik: Excellent. How have you been reflecting on those strengths since our last session?  
Omar: Well, I’ve been thinking about how my curiosity has led me to explore various AI applications beyond my research—like ethical implications and industry trends. It’s made me realize I might want to work in a more applied tech role after my PhD, rather than academia.  
Malik: That’s a valuable insight. It shows your curiosity is guiding you toward practical impact, which can be a strong foundation for your next steps. Have you started to look into specific industries or roles?  
Omar: I’ve looked into AI startups and tech companies, but I’m not sure how transferable my academic skills are. Also, I worry about leaving the comfort of research.  
Malik: Those are common concerns. Remember, your research experience—like data analysis, problem-solving, and project management—are highly transferable. It’s about reframing your narrative from “leaving academia” to “transitioning into industry with a unique research perspective.” Would you like to explore how your academic skills align with industry needs?  
Omar: Yes, that would help. Sometimes I feel like I’m too specialized to move into a different field.  
Malik: Let’s do a quick exercise. Think of your top three skills or strengths from your research experience.  
Omar: Okay. First, data analysis. Second, designing experiments. Third, writing and communicating complex ideas clearly.  
Malik: Great. Now, how could these skills translate into a role in, say, an AI product team or a data-driven startup?  
Omar: Well, data analysis is obviously useful for product optimization. Experiment design could help in testing new features or algorithms. And clear communication is vital for explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.  
Malik: Exactly. Your story is one of a researcher with hands-on technical skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas—assets in many industry roles. How does that reframing feel to you?  
Omar: It feels a bit more hopeful. Like I have options I hadn’t considered before.  
Malik: That’s wonderful. Remember, your narrative isn’t fixed; it evolves with your experiences. Speaking of which, have you reached out to any industry contacts or networked recently?  
Omar: I’ve sent a few emails to alumni and some LinkedIn connections, but I haven’t heard back yet.  
Malik: Networking can be slow, especially in academia and tech. Let’s look at your approach—are you tailoring your messages to highlight your transferable skills and genuine interest?  
Omar: Not entirely. I’ve been mostly asking for informational interviews without much personalization.  
Malik: Personalization makes a big difference. Next time, try to connect your background to their work specifically—mentioning projects or research they’ve done that resonate with you. It helps build rapport. Would you like me to help craft a sample message?  
Omar: Yes, that would be helpful.  
Malik: Great. Moving forward, let’s also set a goal to identify at least three specific companies or roles you’re interested in. Have you thought about using the career path suggestion engine I mentioned last time?  
Omar: I did. It provided some options, but I haven’t explored it deeply yet. I’ll revisit it this week.  
Malik: Excellent. Remember, the goal is to connect your strengths and interests with concrete opportunities. Before we wrap up today, how are you feeling about your overall progress?  
Omar: I think I’m starting to see a clearer picture, even if it’s still fuzzy. The reframing of my skills and story is helping me feel more confident.  
Malik: That’s fantastic to hear. Confidence grows as your narrative becomes more coherent and aligned with your values. For next week, your action items are: refine your LinkedIn outreach messages, explore three industries or roles in more depth, and reflect on your core values—what truly matters to you in your career and life.  
Omar: Got it. Thank you, Malik. I feel more motivated now.  
Malik: You’re doing great, Omar. Remember, your story is your strength. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week.  
Omar: Thanks. See you next week.  
Malik: Take care. (smiles)
