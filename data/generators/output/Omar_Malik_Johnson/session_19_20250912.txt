Session 19/24
Date: September 12, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything—balancing research, thinking about the future, and just trying to keep up with everything. (sighs softly)  
Malik: That’s understandable, Omar. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot right now. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been most on your mind these days?  

[09:05]  
Omar: Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want to do after my PhD. I know I want to leave academia eventually, but I’m not sure what’s next. I’ve looked into industry roles, but I don’t quite see myself in a corporate setting. Plus, I worry about losing the research skills I’ve developed.  
Malik: That’s a common concern, especially for someone so deeply immersed in academia. It’s great that you’re already exploring options. Do you remember the last time we talked about your core strengths and values?  

[09:10]  
Omar: Yes, I think so. We did a strengths assessment, and I realized I’m pretty good at problem-solving, analytical thinking, and explaining complex ideas clearly. I also value autonomy and meaningful work.  
Malik: Exactly. Those are powerful assets. And your value of autonomy suggests you’d thrive in roles that allow independence and creative problem-solving. How do those strengths and values align with your current perceptions of industry opportunities?  

[09:15]]  
Omar: Honestly, I’ve been hesitant. I keep thinking about whether I’d find a role that’s both challenging and meaningful. Sometimes I feel like I might have to compromise—that I’d end up in something less stimulating just to get out of the academic grind.  
Malik: It’s completely natural to have that fear. The key is to reframe the narrative: rather than viewing it as compromise, think of it as a transition—an opportunity to find work that aligns with your strengths and values in a different context. Have you tried to map out what that ideal role might look like?  

[09:20]  
Omar: Not really in detail. I’ve just been kind of bouncing around ideas—maybe data scientist, maybe tech consultant, but I don’t know how well my skills transfer. I feel stuck.  
Malik: That’s a good starting point. Let’s explore your transferable skills more intentionally. For example, your experience with data analysis, research methodology, and technical communication are highly valuable in many industries. Would you be open to doing a strengths storytelling exercise now, to help you see your skills through a different lens?  

[09:25]  
Omar: Sure, I think that could help.  
Malik: Great. I’d like you to think of a recent situation where you solved a complex problem or explained a difficult concept clearly. Can you describe that moment, and how you approached it?  

[09:30]  
Omar: Well, last semester, I helped a fellow student understand a particularly tricky machine learning paper. I broke down the concepts into simpler terms and created a visual diagram. It took some patience, but they appreciated it. I guess that shows my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly.  
Malik: Exactly. That’s a strong story of your problem-solving and communication skills. These are highly sought after in roles like data analysis, technical consulting, or product management. How does viewing this story change your perspective on your skills?  

[09:35]  
Omar: It makes me see my skills in a broader context. I always thought I was limited to academia, but I do have skills that could transfer into industry. Maybe I just need to frame them differently when I talk to potential employers.  
Malik: That’s a powerful insight. Reframing your story—your narrative—is key here. Let’s work on a brief personal pitch that highlights these transferable skills and aligns with your values. Would that be helpful?  

[09:40]  
Omar: Yes, I think that would give me more confidence.  
Malik: Perfect. Before we do that, I’d like to check in on your network-building efforts. Have you reached out to anyone in industry or attended any informational interviews since our last session?  

[09:45]  
Omar: I’ve sent a few LinkedIn connection requests, but I haven’t had any responses yet. I’m a bit nervous about reaching out directly. I’m worried about sounding pushy or not knowing what to say.  
Malik: That’s a common feeling. Remember, your goal is to build genuine connections—people appreciate authenticity. I suggest starting with a simple message that expresses your interest in their work and asks for a brief chat. Would you like to craft a sample message together now?  

[09:50]  
Omar: That sounds good. Maybe something like, “Hi, I’m Omar, a PhD candidate exploring career options in AI and tech. I admire your work in industry and would love to learn about your career path—would you be open to a quick chat?”  
Malik: That’s a strong start. It’s polite, specific, and shows genuine interest. Let’s refine it slightly to add a personal touch—perhaps mentioning something specific about their work or an article they wrote. Do you have an example?  

Omar: Actually, I saw their recent talk on machine learning applications in healthcare. I could mention that.  
Malik: Perfect. So, it might read: “Hi, I’m Omar, a PhD candidate in AI. I recently watched your talk on machine learning in healthcare and found it inspiring. I’d love to hear more about your experience in industry—would you be open to a quick chat?”  

Omar: Yes, I like that. It feels more personal and shows I’ve done my homework.  
Malik: Exactly. Small steps like this can help you build your network steadily. Now, as we approach the end of our session, I want to revisit your next steps. Based on today’s discussion, what actions will you commit to before our next meeting?  

[09:55]  
Omar: I’ll work on refining my personal pitch, using the story we discussed. I’ll also send out at least three tailored LinkedIn messages to industry contacts, including the one we crafted. And I’ll spend some time listing my transferable skills in more detail to reinforce my story.  
Malik: Those are excellent action items. Remember, progress may feel slow at first, but consistency is key. I look forward to hearing about your experiences with these outreach efforts and how your story evolves. Do you want to set a specific date for our next session?  

Omar: Let’s schedule it for next Wednesday at the same time.  
Malik: Perfect. I’ll see you then, Omar. Keep reflecting on your strengths and stay curious. You’re making meaningful progress.  

[09:59]  
Omar: Thanks, Malik. I appreciate your support and guidance.  
Malik: You’re very welcome. Have a great week, and take care!
