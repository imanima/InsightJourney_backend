09:00  
Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything—especially about figuring out what I want to do after my PhD.  
Malik Johnson: That’s completely understandable, Omar. These transitions can feel quite daunting, especially when you're balancing so much. Would you like to start by sharing any recent thoughts or reflections you've had since we last spoke?  

[09:05]  
Omar: Well, I’ve been trying to look at my skills more objectively. I did a strengths assessment last week, and I realized I really enjoy solving complex problems and explaining technical concepts clearly. But I’m not sure how that translates into potential careers outside academia.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a great start. Recognizing your strengths is essential. When you say you enjoy solving complex problems and explaining concepts, it sounds like you have analytical skills and communication strengths. Have you thought about industries or roles where those skills are highly valued?  

[09:10]  
Omar: Not really. I’ve mostly been focused on my research and teaching. But I guess I could look into tech companies or even consulting, maybe? I’m also curious about roles in data analysis or technical writing.  

Malik Johnson: Those are promising directions. You mentioned consulting—what kind of consulting appeals to you? And how do you see your skills fitting into those roles?  

Omar: Well, I think consulting in AI or tech strategy could be interesting. I enjoy applying my research to real-world problems, and I like the idea of helping organizations improve through technology. But I worry I might not have enough business experience.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a common concern. Remember, your technical expertise and problem-solving abilities are highly transferable. Many consultants value deep technical knowledge combined with the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly. Have you considered ways to build business or consulting skills—perhaps through online courses, mentorship, or networking?  

[09:15]  
Omar: I’ve thought about taking some business courses, but I’m not sure where to start or if I should focus on that now. I also feel a bit stuck because I don’t have a clear target role yet.  

Malik Johnson: That makes sense. Let’s step back for a moment. Since our work is strengths-based, how about we revisit your story? Can you tell me about a time when you felt most engaged and confident during your academic journey?  

Omar: (pauses, thinking) Hmm… I think it was during my master’s thesis. I was working on a project that involved developing a new algorithm. I loved the problem-solving aspect and felt excited when I finally got it to work. It felt like I was making a real impact.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a powerful memory. It highlights your passion for technical problem-solving and impact. How might you incorporate those elements into your future career?  

Omar: Maybe roles that involve innovation and practical problem-solving, like R&D or product development? Or even working on AI applications that help people?  

Malik Johnson: Exactly. Those stories reveal core parts of your identity—your strengths and passions. When you think about future roles, can you envision a narrative where your skills and passions align with specific industries or positions?  

[09:20]  
Omar: I think I could see myself in a role that combines research and practical application, like developing AI tools for healthcare or education. I’m passionate about making a real difference, not just publishing papers.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a compelling story—your desire to impact lives directly through innovative AI solutions. Now, considering this narrative, what steps can you take next to explore these options further?  

Omar: I could start by researching companies working in AI for healthcare, maybe reach out for informational interviews. I also want to update my resume to highlight transferable skills.  

Malik Johnson: Those are excellent next steps. Remember, your narrative is a powerful tool—use it to frame your experiences when talking to potential employers or mentors. Have you thought about creating a story map or a visual timeline of your journey so far?  

[09:25]  
Omar: Not yet, but that sounds helpful. I’ve been using a reflection journal, but a visual map could give me a clearer picture of my strengths and experiences.  

Malik Johnson: Great. Let’s plan to work on that in our next session. For today, I suggest you draft a brief personal story highlighting your problem-solving passion, your technical skills, and your desire to make a difference. This will serve as your narrative foundation for networking and applications.  

Omar: Okay, I can do that. It feels good to have a clearer direction.  

Malik Johnson: Wonderful. Before we wrap up, let’s briefly check in on your work-life balance. How are you managing stress and burnout lately?  

[09:30]  
Omar: Honestly, I still feel exhausted sometimes. I’ve been trying to set boundaries, but I get caught up with research deadlines. I think I need to structure my time better.  

Malik Johnson: That’s a common challenge. Remember, sustaining your energy is crucial for long-term success. Maybe integrating small routines for self-care—like short walks or mindfulness—could help. Would you like some quick techniques to try before our next session?  

Omar: Yes, that would be helpful. I think I need to start with manageable changes.  

Malik Johnson: Excellent. We’ll explore some strategies next time. For now, your action items are:  
- Draft your personal narrative focusing on your problem-solving passion and impact.  
- Research AI healthcare companies and prepare a list of potential contacts for informational interviews.  
- Reflect on ways to incorporate self-care routines into your schedule.  

Omar: Got it. Thanks, Malik. This session helped me see a clearer path forward.  

Malik Johnson: I’m glad to hear that, Omar. Remember, your story is your strength. I look forward to seeing your narrative and hearing about your progress next week. Have a great day!  

Omar: Thanks, you too!
