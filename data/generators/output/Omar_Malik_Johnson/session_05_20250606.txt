Date: June 06, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 [Start of Session] Malik: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. A bit overwhelmed with the research, but I’ve started to think more about what I might do after my PhD.  

09:05 Malik: That’s a good place to be—recognizing your current feelings. Last time, we touched on your sense of burnout and some uncertainty about your next steps. Have you had any new insights or experiences around that?  

Omar: Yeah, I’ve been trying to reflect on my skills and interests outside of just my research. I looked back at some of the projects I enjoyed most, like the data visualization work I did for a conference last year. It made me wonder if I should explore more roles that combine research with communication.  

09:10 Malik: That’s a valuable realization. It sounds like you’re identifying some transferable skills—like data analysis, visualization, and perhaps even presenting complex ideas clearly. How does thinking about combining research and communication feel to you?  
Omar (pauses): Honestly, it feels promising but also a bit uncertain. I worry about losing the depth of my technical skills if I move into more communication-focused roles.  

09:15 Malik: That’s a common concern. Remember, part of our narrative work is about reframing. Your technical skills are a strong foundation—you can build a narrative that emphasizes your versatility. For example, your research background could position you as a bridge between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders. How does that framing sound?  

Omar: I like that. It makes my experience feel more flexible, like I have options I hadn’t considered. I’m also wondering how I can explore these pathways without feeling like I’m abandoning my current focus.  

09:20 Malik: Excellent point. It’s about expansion, not abandonment. We can map out a career journey that integrates your current skills with new opportunities. Have you thought about informational interviews with professionals in fields like data journalism, science communication, or industry R&D?  

Omar: I’ve thought about reaching out, but I wasn’t sure how to approach them or what to say. I worry about seeming unprepared.  

09:25 Malik: That’s understandable. We can develop a tailored script for your outreach. Remember, most people appreciate genuine curiosity. I suggest framing your message around your interest in their work and asking specific questions about their career paths. Would you like me to help craft a sample message?  

Omar: Yes, please. That would help a lot. I want to make sure I’m respectful of their time but also clear about my goals.  

09:30 Malik: Great. Here’s a draft: “Hi [Name], I’m Omar, a PhD candidate specializing in AI and data analysis. I’ve been exploring career options beyond academia and came across your work in science communication. I’d love to hear about your journey and any advice for someone looking to transition into this space. Would you be open to a brief chat?” How does that sound?  
Omar: That sounds good. It’s polite and straightforward. I think I can personalize it further once I identify specific people.  

09:35 Malik: Perfect. Personalization will make your outreach more authentic. Now, let’s reflect on where you see yourself in the next six months. Considering your current interests, what are some concrete steps you could take?  
Omar: I think I should start by reaching out to at least three professionals, maybe attend a couple of networking events or webinars related to science communication, and also work on updating my resume to highlight transferable skills.  

09:40 Malik: Those are excellent steps. And how about balancing this with your research workload? Burnout has been an issue, so maintaining your well-being is crucial. Have you considered scheduling dedicated reflection time or short breaks to decompress?  
Omar: I’ve been trying to push through, but I realize I need to be more intentional about taking breaks. Maybe I can set a weekly goal to reflect on my progress and feelings.  

09:45 Malik: That’s a strong idea. Regular reflection helps you stay aligned with your values and goals. Would it help if we created a simple journal prompt for these reflections? Something like, “What did I accomplish this week? What did I enjoy? What challenges did I face, and how can I address them next week?”  
Omar: Yes, I think that would help me stay focused and aware of my emotions.  

09:50 Malik: Great. Let’s plan to review your reflections in our next session and see how your outreach and networking are progressing. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to explore or any questions?  

Omar: I think I’d like to work on clarifying my core values next time. I feel like understanding that better could help me make more confident decisions about my career.  

09:55 Malik: That’s an important step. Values clarification anchors your choices and helps you craft a compelling narrative. We can do a values exercise next time, maybe using a story mapping technique to identify what truly matters to you.  

Omar: Sounds good. I’m looking forward to it. Thanks, Malik. This session has helped me see more options and feel a bit more hopeful.  

09:59 Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Omar. You’re making meaningful progress. For next time, please try reaching out to at least one contact and jot down your reflections this week. I’ll see you in our next session. Have a great week!
