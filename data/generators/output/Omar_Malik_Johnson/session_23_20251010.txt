Session 23/24
Date: October 10, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay, I think. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything—especially trying to figure out what I want to do after my PhD. (pauses) I guess I’m stuck in that place of uncertainty.  

09:07  
Malik: That’s completely understandable. It’s a common feeling, especially at this stage of your academic journey. Last time, we touched on some of your core values and strengths. Have you had a chance to reflect on those or explore any new ideas about your future?  

Omar: Yeah, I spent some time thinking about what I value most—creativity, problem-solving, and making an impact. I also looked at my strengths, like analytical thinking and persistence. But when I try to connect those to potential careers, I get stuck. It feels too broad.  

09:15  
Malik: That’s a good start, Omar. Recognizing your core values and strengths is crucial. Sometimes, the next step is to map them onto different industries or roles. Have you thought about how these skills and values might translate outside academia?  

Omar: I’ve considered tech companies, maybe R&D roles in industry, but I’m worried about losing the academic environment I’m used to. Plus, I don’t know what non-academic jobs really look like. I haven’t done much networking outside of my research circle.  

09:22  
Malik: That’s a common concern. Transitioning from academia to industry can feel daunting, but your skills are highly transferable. For example, your research experience and analytical mindset are valuable in data science or AI product development. Have you looked into any specific industries or companies?  

Omar: Not in detail. I’ve mostly been researching different fields, but I haven’t reached out or spoken to anyone in those areas yet. I guess I feel hesitant to start those conversations.  

09:30  
Malik: That hesitation is understandable. Building a professional network can feel intimidating at first, especially if you’re unsure what to say. Let’s think about some small, manageable steps. For instance, informational interviews could be a good way to learn more about those industries without the pressure of a job application. Would you be open to identifying a few people you could reach out to?  

Omar: Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe professors I know in industry or alumni from my program? I have a couple of contacts in tech, but I haven't contacted them yet.  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a solid plan. Reaching out to familiar contacts can make the process less intimidating. Remember, you don’t need to ask for a job—just for insights and advice. It’s about building relationships and gathering information. Do you want to draft a quick message together now?  

Omar: Sure, that would help. (leans forward slightly) I guess I’m worried about sounding unsure or inexperienced.  

09:50  
Malik: That’s a common concern. It’s okay to be honest about your curiosity and your current situation. A simple message could be: “Hi [Name], I hope you’re doing well. I’m currently exploring career options outside academia and would value your insights on working in the AI industry. Would you be open to a brief chat? Thanks so much for your time.” How does that sound?  

Omar: That’s clear and polite. I can tweak it a bit to sound more personal.  

09:58  
Malik: Great! Personal touches always help. Remember, these conversations are also opportunities for you to learn what you enjoy and what doesn’t excite you—an important part of your career mapping. Now, let’s revisit your strengths story. Can you recall a recent research project where you felt particularly effective or proud?  

Omar: Actually, yes. Last semester, I led a project on optimizing neural network models. I enjoyed figuring out complex problems and collaborating with my team. It felt impactful, and I received positive feedback from my advisor.  

10:07  
Malik: That’s a strong example. How would you describe the story of that experience—your role, the challenge, and the outcome?  

Omar: Well, I was the lead researcher. The challenge was improving the model’s accuracy without increasing computational costs. I analyzed the data, experimented with different algorithms, and coordinated with my team. We managed to increase accuracy by 15%, which was a big win. I felt proud of my analytical skills and leadership.  

10:15  
Malik: Fantastic. That story highlights your problem-solving ability and leadership—both highly valued in many fields. How might you reframe that story when talking to someone outside academia?  

Omar: Maybe as: “I led a team to improve AI model performance, solving complex technical challenges and delivering measurable results.” That sounds more industry-oriented.  

10:23  
Malik: Exactly. Framing your experiences in terms of skills and results makes them relatable across sectors. Now, thinking ahead, what’s one small step you can take this week toward your career exploration?  

Omar: I could identify three contacts in the industry, draft messages, and send them out. Also, I might look into some online courses or webinars on AI applications outside academia.  

10:30  
Malik: That sounds like a proactive plan. Remember to pace yourself—building a network takes time. And exploring online resources can help you get a clearer picture of different roles. How are you feeling about your next steps?  

Omar: A bit more confident, I think. Having a plan helps reduce the anxiety. I still feel nervous about reaching out, but I see it as necessary.  

10:38  
Malik: That’s a healthy perspective. Nerves are normal, but they often diminish once you take that first step. As we wrap up, I want you to reflect on your strengths and how they can guide your choices. Also, keep in mind your values—creativity, impact, persistence—and how they can shape your career story.  

Omar: Thanks, Malik. This session helped me see my experience in a new light and gave me some concrete actions.  

10:45  
Malik: I’m glad to hear that. For our next session, let’s check in on your outreach efforts and explore any new insights you gather. Also, we can refine your story further and discuss potential opportunities that align with your values and skills.  

Omar: Sounds good. I’ll aim to send those messages and reflect on what I learn.  

10:50  
Malik: Excellent. Remember, Omar, your journey is about storytelling—crafting your narrative with purpose and authenticity. I look forward to hearing about your progress. Have a great week!  

Omar: Thanks, Malik. You too. (smiles) See you next time.
