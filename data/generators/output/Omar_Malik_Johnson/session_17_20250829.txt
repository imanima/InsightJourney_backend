Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[09:02] Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I've been okay, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the options out there, but I’ve been trying to stay focused.

[09:04] Malik: That’s understandable, especially given the uncertainty around your career path. Last time, we talked about your core strengths and values. Have you had a chance to reflect further on those?

[09:07] Omar: Yes, I spent some time journaling and thinking about my skills. I realized I’m pretty good at problem-solving and data analysis, which I use a lot in my research. But I’m not sure how those transfer outside academia.

[09:09] Malik: That’s a great insight. Recognizing your transferable skills is a key step. Have you thought about different industries or roles where problem-solving and data analysis are valued?

[09:12] Omar: I’ve looked into tech companies, maybe in data science or product management. But I’m worried about starting over and whether I’d be able to adapt.

[09:15] Malik: It's natural to feel uncertain. Remember, your skills are highly valued across many fields, not just academia. Have you considered framing your research experience in terms of project management, collaboration, and technical expertise?

[09:18] Omar: I hadn’t thought about it that way. I guess I tend to see my work as very academic, but I can see how those skills could be relevant elsewhere.

[09:21] Malik: Exactly. Sometimes, we need to reframe our story. Think of yourself as a researcher and problem solver with a strong analytical mindset—qualities that many industries seek. Would you be interested in exploring a hero’s journey map for your career story?

[09:24] Omar: Yeah, that sounds interesting. I think it could help me see my experiences in a new light.

[09:26] Malik: Great. Let’s start with your current situation—the “ordinary world”—your PhD work. Then, we’ll identify the “call to adventure”—your desire for a different career. From there, we can map potential “mentors” and “challenges.” Does that resonate?

[09:29] Omar: Yes, I like that framework. It feels empowering to think of my career as a story where I can choose my next chapter.

[09:31] Malik: Perfect. Before we dive into that, how are you feeling emotionally about your progress so far?

[09:33] Omar: Honestly, I feel a bit more hopeful. Talking through my skills and stories helps me see possibilities I hadn’t considered.

[09:36] Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Hope is a powerful motivator. Now, let’s look at your hero’s journey—what was a recent challenge you faced, and how did you overcome it?

[09:39] Omar: Well, I was struggling with burnout, especially during exam preparation. I pushed myself too hard, but I eventually took a short break, talked with my advisor, and restructured my schedule. It helped me regain some balance.

[09:42] Malik: That’s a great example of resilience. Recognizing that you can adapt and seek support is a strength. How might this experience influence your approach to future career transitions?

[09:45] Omar: I think it shows I can handle setbacks and that I need to give myself space to explore and not rush.

[09:47] Malik: Absolutely. Building that self-awareness and patience will serve you well. Now, returning to your story, what “mentor” figures—people or resources—have supported you so far?

[09:50] Omar: My advisor has been helpful, and I’ve connected with some alumni through LinkedIn who work in industry. Their stories inspired me.

[09:53] Malik: Those are valuable connections. Have you considered reaching out for informational interviews to learn more about their careers?

[09:55] Omar: I’ve thought about it but haven’t done it yet. I worry about bothering them or not knowing what to ask.

[09:58] Malik: That’s a common concern. I can help you craft a brief message. Remember, most people enjoy sharing their experiences and can offer valuable advice. Would you like to practice that now?

[10:00] Omar: Yes, please. That would be helpful.

[10:02] Malik: Great. Let’s draft a message together. Start with a polite introduction, mention your shared connection or interest, and express curiosity about their career path.

(They spend a few minutes role-playing and refining the message.)

[10:08] Malik: How do you feel about reaching out now?

[10:10] Omar: More confident. I see it as an opportunity rather than a burden.

[10:12] Malik: Excellent. Building a professional network is a key step in your transition. Now, looking ahead, what are some small, actionable steps you can take before our next session?

[10:15] Omar: I’ll draft a few messages to alumni and research some industry roles online. Also, I want to update my resume to highlight transferable skills.

[10:17] Malik: Sounds like a solid plan. Remember, you’re creating a new story with each step. How are you feeling about your overall progress so far?

[10:20] Omar: I’m feeling more focused and less stuck. It’s reassuring to see how my skills can fit into different narratives.

[10:22] Malik: That’s wonderful progress. Next time, we can explore specific job opportunities and refine your story even further. Any questions or thoughts before we wrap up?

[10:25] Omar: No, I think I’m good for now. Thanks, Malik. This really helped me see my story in a new way.

[10:27] Malik: My pleasure, Omar. Keep reflecting, and I look forward to hearing about your outreach and next steps. See you next week.

[10:29] Omar: Thanks, Malik. Have a great day.

[10:30] Malik: You too. Take care.
