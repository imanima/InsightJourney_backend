Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

**09:00** Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
*(Warm, attentive)*

**Omar:** Hi Malik. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything—balancing research, coursework, and trying to figure out what’s next after my PhD.  

**Malik:** That’s understandable, Omar. Juggling so many aspects can be taxing, especially when you’re also exploring future paths. Last time, we touched on your core values and strengths. How has reflecting on those been for you?  

**Omar:** It’s been helpful. I’ve started to see some patterns—like my curiosity and desire to contribute meaningfully. But I still feel unsure about which direction to take. Sometimes I worry I’m not good enough to switch fields or even find a clear path within academia.  

**Malik:** Those are very common feelings, especially at this stage. Remember, your curiosity and desire to contribute are strengths—they’re part of your narrative. Have you thought about how these qualities might serve you in other industries or roles outside academia?  

**Omar:** A bit. I’ve looked into tech companies that focus on AI, but I wonder if I should just stick with academia since that’s what I know. I worry about leaving my comfort zone and starting over.  

**Malik:** That’s a valid concern. Change can be daunting, especially when it involves leaving the familiar. Let’s try reframing that a little—what if we viewed your current skills and passions as a foundation rather than a boundary? For example, your research skills and technical expertise are highly valued in many industries beyond academia.  

**Omar:** Hmm, that makes sense. I guess I haven’t really considered how transferable my skills are. I tend to see my experience as limited to research and teaching.  

**Malik:** That’s a common narrative, but often it’s a story we tell ourselves that limits us. Let’s do a quick strengths assessment. Can you recall some moments—either during research or teaching—where you felt particularly effective or proud?  

**Omar:** Well, I remember leading a workshop for undergrads last semester. I received positive feedback on how I explained complex AI concepts clearly. It made me realize I have good communication skills.  

**Malik:** Excellent. That’s a key transferable skill—communication. And it ties into your desire to contribute meaningfully. How about problem-solving or analytical skills? Any moments that stand out?  

**Omar:** During data analysis for my thesis, I developed a new method to improve model accuracy. It was challenging, but I enjoyed the process of troubleshooting and optimizing the algorithms.  

**Malik:** That’s fantastic. It shows your technical problem-solving ability, which is highly valued across many fields, like tech, consulting, or data-driven roles. So, thinking about your narrative, how might these stories—your workshop leadership and data problem-solving—fit into a broader career map?  

**Omar:** I suppose they show I’m capable of teaching, explaining complex ideas, and tackling technical challenges. But I still feel stuck on how to position myself beyond academia.  

**Malik:** That’s where storytelling comes in. Let’s try framing your narrative: Imagine you’re the hero in your career story. Your journey involves deep research, overcoming technical challenges, and mentoring others. Now, what’s the next chapter?  

**Omar:** Maybe the next chapter is applying my skills in industry, perhaps in AI product development or research roles in tech companies?  

**Malik:** That’s a compelling direction. And what about the values you identified last time—contributing to innovation, continuous learning, and helping others understand complex ideas? How do those resonate in this new chapter?  

**Omar:** They fit well. I want to be in an environment that values innovation and learning, where I can continue growing and maybe even mentor others.  

**Malik:** Excellent. Now, let’s think about concrete steps. Have you considered informational interviews with professionals in those industries?  

**Omar:** I’ve thought about it, but I haven’t reached out yet. Honestly, I’m a bit nervous about that.  

**Malik:** That’s normal. Reframing it as a learning opportunity rather than a test of your worth can help. Would you like to draft a simple message now to reach out to someone?  

**Omar:** Sure, I can try.  

**(Omar pulls out his laptop, and Malik guides him through drafting a professional, genuine message)**

**09:40** Malik: Great, how does this sound? “Hi [Name], I’m Omar, a PhD candidate in AI at [University]. I admire your work in [industry/area], and I’m eager to learn more about your career path and any advice you might have for someone transitioning from academia to industry. Would you be open to a brief chat?”  

**Omar:** That’s good. I think I can send that.  

**Malik:** Perfect. Remember, building your network is about curiosity and connection. How are you feeling about next steps?  

**Omar:** More hopeful, honestly. It’s starting to feel less like a big unknown and more like small, manageable steps.  

**Malik:** That’s a great shift. Before we finish, let’s quickly check in on your work-life balance. Any recent moments where you felt overwhelmed?  

**Omar:** Yeah, last week I stayed up late finishing a paper, and I felt burnt out afterward. I realize I need to set clearer boundaries.  

**Malik:** That awareness is key. Next time, try scheduling breaks or activities outside your research. Small shifts can make a big difference.  

**Omar:** I will. Thanks, Malik. I feel more equipped now.  

**Malik:** You’re making excellent progress, Omar. For next week, let’s aim to follow up on those networking contacts and explore other potential career options.  

**Omar:** Sounds good. I’ll do that. Thanks again.  

**Malik:** You’re welcome. Looking forward to hearing about your outreach. Have a great week, Omar.  

**Omar:** You too. Bye!  

**Malik:** Bye!
