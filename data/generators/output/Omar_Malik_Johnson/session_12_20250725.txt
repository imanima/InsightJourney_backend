Date: July 25, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar! Glad we could connect again. How have you been since our last session? Any particular thoughts or feelings you'd like to share today?

[09:05] Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. The research burnout is hitting hard, and I’m struggling to see a clear path forward. I also feel like I’ve been stuck in a cycle of doubt about what I want after the PhD.

[09:07] Malik: That sounds tough, Omar. Burnout can really cloud our sense of direction. It’s good you’re recognizing these feelings—that’s the first step. Last time, you mentioned wanting to explore alternative careers and identify your transferable skills. How has that been going?

[09:10] Omar: I’ve tried to reflect on my skills, but honestly, I keep circling back to my research. I know I’m good at data analysis, problem-solving, and writing, but I’m unsure how those translate outside academia.

[09:12] Malik: That’s a common feeling—perfectionists often find it hard to see how their skills fit into other roles. Let’s revisit your strengths. Remember the strengths mapping we did last month? Can you tell me if anything has shifted or become clearer since then?

[09:15] Omar: Well, I think I’ve become more aware of how much I enjoy breaking down complex problems. Also, I realized I like the storytelling aspect of writing research papers, which could translate into roles like technical communication or content creation.

[09:17] Malik: Excellent insight. That storytelling element is powerful—it's a transferable skill many industries value. Have you considered exploring careers in science communication, technical writing, or even data storytelling in industry settings?

[09:20] Omar: I’ve looked into some science communication roles online, but I don’t know if I’d enjoy working outside academia. Part of me still feels attached to the research environment.

[09:22] Malik: That’s understandable. It’s important not to rush. Let’s try framing your story: what parts of your academic journey have been most meaningful to you? What strengths did you develop that could serve you well elsewhere?

[09:25] Omar: I’d say the mentorship I provided to undergrads, and the way I mentored them through complex projects. I also enjoyed designing experiments and analyzing data, which involved a lot of storytelling to make sense of findings.

[09:28] Malik: Those are powerful skills—mentoring shows leadership and communication, while experiment design and analysis reveal your analytical thinking. How might these skills transfer to industry roles? For example, in product management, data analysis, or technical consulting?

[09:30] Omar: Hmm, I hadn’t thought about product management. I do like coordinating projects and communicating technical ideas clearly. That could be a good fit.

[09:33] Malik: Great connection. Now, considering your values—what matters most to you in your work? Is it creativity, impact, autonomy, or something else?

[09:35] Omar: Impact is important. I want my work to make a difference, maybe in AI applications that help society or solve real problems.

[09:37] Malik: That’s a strong motivator. Combining your analytical skills, storytelling, and desire for impact, roles in AI ethics, policy, or socially-driven AI projects might resonate with you.

[09:40] Omar: Yeah, I like that idea. It feels more aligned with my values than just pure research.

[09:42] Malik: Fantastic. Remember, your story is multi-faceted—your research skills, mentorship, storytelling, and values all weave into a unique narrative. Today, let’s map out some concrete next steps. How does that sound?

[09:45] Omar: Sounds good. I think I need a clearer plan to move forward without feeling so lost.

[09:48] Malik: Absolutely. So, for next steps, I suggest:
- Research and identify at least three industries or roles that align with your skills and values.
- Reach out to at least two professionals in those fields for informational interviews.
- Reflect in your journal about what you learn and how these roles resonate with your story.
- Continue refining your strengths story, perhaps using the hero’s journey framework we discussed previously.

Does that feel manageable for you?

[09:50] Omar: Yes, I can do that. I think talking to people will help me see options more clearly.

[09:52] Malik: Excellent. And remember, this is a process—your story evolves as you gather new insights. We’ll review your progress next week. Before we wrap up, any lingering questions or thoughts?

[09:55] Omar: Just one—how do I stay motivated when I feel like I’m going in circles?

[09:58] Malik: That’s a common challenge. I suggest revisiting your core values regularly—reminding yourself why you started—and celebrating small wins, like completing an informational interview or updating your resume. Also, be gentle with yourself—progress isn’t always linear.

[10:00] Omar: Thanks, Malik. That helps a lot. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

[10:02] Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Omar. Keep nurturing your story, and remember, you have a wealth of skills and purpose to build on. Let’s check in next week and see how these steps go. Have a great week ahead!

[10:04] Omar: Thanks, Malik. Talk to you next week.
