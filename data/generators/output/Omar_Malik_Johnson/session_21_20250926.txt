Session 21/24
Date: September 26, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Omar! It's great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
Omar: Hi Malik. I’m doing okay, I guess. A bit overwhelmed but also curious about where to go next with my career. (pauses) I’ve been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time, especially about identifying my transferable skills.  

09:05  
Malik: That’s a great starting point. Last session, you mentioned feeling uncertain about your next steps after finishing your PhD. Have you had any new insights or reflections since then?  
Omar: Yeah, I’ve been trying to map out my skills. I realized I’m pretty strong in data analysis, programming, and problem-solving. But I’m not sure how those skills translate outside academia. (looks thoughtful) I also feel like I’ve been stuck in my head a lot, overthinking.  

09:10  
Malik: That’s very common, especially for perfectionists like you. Let’s explore how these skills might connect to other industries. Can you think of any fields or roles where data and problem-solving are crucial?  
Omar: Well, I’ve looked into tech companies, maybe data science roles. But I’m also curious about AI applications in healthcare or finance. I just don’t know if I’d enjoy working outside academia. (frowning slightly) I worry about losing the intellectual challenge I get from research.  

09:15  
Malik: Those are valid concerns. Remember, your story is not just about what you do now but about what you want to achieve. When you think about your strengths, what kind of impact do you want your work to have?  
Omar: Hmm… I want to contribute to meaningful projects, maybe improve lives somehow. I like the idea of applying AI to solve real-world problems. But I also value independence and intellectual freedom.  

09:20  
Malik: Excellent. It sounds like you’re drawn to roles that combine technical challenge with purpose. Let's revisit the Hero’s Journey framework we used earlier—what would your "call to adventure" look like in this context?  
Omar: (smiles softly) I guess it would be stepping out of the academic bubble and exploring industries where I can apply my skills to real problems, maybe even leading projects that make a difference. But I feel nervous about leaving the comfort zone.  

09:25  
Malik: That’s a natural feeling. Change often involves stepping into the unknown. We can think of this as your “mentor” phase—gathering knowledge, building confidence, and mapping out your path. Have you started any informational interviews or networking activities?  
Omar: I reached out to a couple of alumni working in AI startups and healthcare tech. One responded positively, and we scheduled a call next week. (looks more engaged) It’s helpful to hear about their experiences, but I still feel unsure about how to position myself.  

09:30  
Malik: That’s a great step forward. How do you think your academic skills translate into those roles?  
Omar: Well, I think my data analysis and research skills are directly relevant. I also have experience presenting complex ideas, which could help in communicating with diverse teams. But I worry about my limited industry experience and whether I’ll be seen as a newcomer.  

09:35  
Malik: Those concerns are understandable. Let’s consider your unique strengths. Besides technical skills, what personal qualities do you bring that can differentiate you?  
Omar: I’m persistent, detail-oriented, and curious. I also think I’m good at critical thinking and adapting to new information. (nods) I guess I haven’t really thought about framing these as part of my story.  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a valuable insight. Your story can highlight your persistence and adaptability, qualities highly valued in industry. Have you thought about crafting a narrative that connects your academic journey with your desire to impact real-world problems?  
Omar: Not explicitly, but I see what you mean. Maybe I can tell a story about how my research in AI has always been driven by a desire to solve practical issues.  

09:45  
Malik: Absolutely. Stories like that can help interviewers see your passion and purpose. Now, thinking about next steps, what specific actions will you take before our next session to build on this?  
Omar: I’ll prepare a short pitch about my skills and story, tailored to industry roles I’m interested in. I also want to follow up with the alumni and try to schedule more informational interviews.  
Malik: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember to reflect on what you learn from each conversation and how it shapes your story.  

09:50  
Malik: To wrap up, let’s identify one area you want to focus on for next time. Would it be refining your narrative, expanding your network, or exploring specific roles?  
Omar: I think I want to focus on storytelling—really shaping my personal narrative to communicate my value confidently.  
Malik: Great choice. We’ll work on that next time. Before we finish, any final thoughts or questions?  
Omar: Just… I appreciate the guidance. It’s helping me see a clearer path, even if it’s still uncertain.  

09:55  
Malik: That’s a big step—recognizing that clarity often comes through exploration. Keep building on these small wins. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll continue refining your story.  
Omar: Thanks, Malik. Looking forward to it. (smiles warmly)
