09:00 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
09:03 [Omar] Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay, I think. A bit overwhelmed with all the research work lately, but I’ve been trying to stay focused.  
09:07 [Malik] Malik Johnson: That’s understandable, especially with the intensity of your PhD program. Last time, we talked about your feelings of burnout and some uncertainty around your career options. How have things evolved since then?  
09:10 [Omar] Omar: Well, I did some reflection on my values and strengths, as you suggested. I realized I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect of my research, but I also feel drawn to tech industry roles that involve innovation and mentorship. It’s like I’m torn between academia and industry.  
09:15 [Malik] Malik Johnson: That’s a valuable insight. Recognizing your enjoyment of problem-solving and desire for mentorship suggests some transferable skills and passions. Can you tell me more about specific industry roles that excite you?  
09:18 [Omar] Omar: I’ve been looking into roles like technical leads, R&D positions, or even product management in AI companies. I like the idea of applying my research skills in real-world products and working with diverse teams.  
09:22 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Excellent. It sounds like you’re interested in roles that combine technical expertise with leadership and innovation. Have you explored how your current skills match those roles?  
09:25 [Omar] Omar: Somewhat. I know I’m strong in data analysis and algorithm development, but I’m not sure how to frame these skills for industry recruiters. I guess I need to develop some transferable skills or a new narrative about my experience.  
09:29 [Malik] Malik Johnson: That’s a good point. Developing a clear professional narrative can help you position yourself effectively. Let’s think about your story—what you’ve achieved, what you value, and how that aligns with industry roles. Remember the hero’s journey we discussed?  
09:33 [Omar] Omar: Yes, I remember. It’s about framing my experience as a story of growth and discovery. I think I want to see my PhD journey as a hero’s quest for knowledge and impact.  
09:36 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Beautiful. Framing your journey as a hero’s quest can highlight your resilience, curiosity, and dedication. Have you tried crafting this narrative in your CV or LinkedIn profile?  
09:39 [Omar] Omar: Not yet, but I think I should. I’ve mostly listed my research projects and skills, but I haven’t told the story of my growth or how I overcame challenges.  
09:43 [Malik] Malik Johnson: That’s a key step. Incorporating story elements—like challenges you faced, lessons learned, and your purpose—can make your profile stand out. Would you like to work on a draft of your professional story today?  
09:47 [Omar] Omar: Yes, I’d like that. I think it’ll help me feel more confident about my direction.  
09:50 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Great. Let’s start by identifying a pivotal moment in your PhD journey—perhaps a challenge you overcame or a breakthrough you experienced. Can you think of one?  
09:54 [Omar] Omar: Hmm, I’d say the time I had to redo my entire data analysis because of a software error. It was frustrating, but I ended up learning a lot about troubleshooting and persistent problem-solving.  
09:58 [Malik] Malik Johnson: That’s a powerful story of resilience. How did that experience change your perspective or skills?  
10:02 [Omar] Omar: It made me more patient and meticulous. I also realized I enjoy digging into complex problems, which I think is valuable in industry roles too.  
10:05 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Exactly. Now, if we frame that as part of your hero’s story, it’s about perseverance leading to mastery. You can incorporate that into your narrative to showcase your problem-solving and resilience.  
10:09 [Omar] Omar: I like that. It makes my experience more dynamic and purposeful.  
10:13 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Perfect. Now, considering your target roles, how do you see your story resonating with industry recruiters?  
10:16 [Omar] Omar: I think it shows I’m resilient, detail-oriented, and passionate about solving hard problems. I can also highlight my experience mentoring undergraduates, which aligns with leadership roles.  
10:20 [Malik] Malik Johnson: That’s a strong narrative. Next, let’s look at your resume and LinkedIn—how you can reframe your experience to tell this story visually and textually. Would you like to do that now?  
10:23 [Omar] Omar: Yes, that would be helpful. I’d like to make sure my profile reflects this new story.  
10:27 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Great. We’ll focus on emphasizing your problem-solving resilience, your mentorship, and your passion for innovation. I’ll also introduce some storytelling techniques to make your profile compelling.  
10:30 [Omar] Omar: Thanks, Malik. I already feel more confident just talking about this.  
10:33 [Malik] Malik Johnson: I’m glad to hear that. Before we wrap up, let’s set some concrete next steps. First, I’d like you to draft a short narrative incorporating the story of your data analysis challenge. Then, we’ll review it in our next session.  
10:36 [Omar] Omar: Sounds good. I’ll do that. Should I also start revising my CV and LinkedIn?  
10:39 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Yes, that’s a great idea. Focus on weaving your story into those profiles—highlighting your resilience, problem-solving, and leadership experiences.  
10:42 [Omar] Omar: Okay, I’ll get started. And I’ll bring my draft narrative next time.  
10:45 [Malik] Malik Johnson: Excellent. Remember, your story is your strength. Keep reflecting on your values and passions as you craft it. I’ll see you next week, and we can review your progress then.  
10:48 [Omar] Omar: Thanks so much, Malik. I appreciate your guidance.  
10:50 [Malik] Malik Johnson: You’re very welcome, Omar. Have a productive week, and take care!
