Session 22/24
Date: October 03, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Omar shifts slightly in his chair, taking a deep breath)  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything, but I’ve started reflecting more on my skills and what I really want from my career.  

[09:05] Malik: That’s a positive step. Reflecting on your skills and desires is key to navigating this transition. Last time, we discussed your core strengths and some potential industries to explore. Have you had any new insights or experiences since then?  

Omar: Yeah, I spent some time reviewing my research and teaching work. I realized I really enjoy mentoring students and explaining complex topics—like a storyteller, I guess. It made me wonder if I should focus more on roles involving mentorship or communication.  

[09:10] Malik: That’s a great observation. You’re recognizing a strength in storytelling and mentorship. How does that align with what you want in your future career?  

Omar: Honestly, I feel a bit torn. Part of me still wants to stay in academia, but another part is curious about industry roles—maybe in AI product management or technical communication. I’m worried about leaving the familiarity of research, though.  

[09:15] Malik: It’s completely normal to feel torn, especially at this crossroads. Remember, your story isn’t about abandoning academia but expanding your narrative to include new chapters. Have you looked into roles outside academia that leverage your skills in storytelling and mentorship?  

Omar: I’ve looked at some job descriptions online—like technical writer, product owner, even community manager—but I don’t have direct experience in those areas. I’m unsure how to position myself for those roles.  

[09:20] Malik: That’s where strategic storytelling can help. We can craft your narrative to highlight transferable skills—like your research expertise, your ability to communicate complex ideas, and your mentorship experience. Would you like to try mapping this out today?  

Omar: Yeah, I’d like that. It feels a bit daunting, but I think it could help clarify my options.  

[09:25] Malik: Excellent. Let’s start by framing your story using the hero’s journey. Think of your current situation as the “call to adventure.” What’s motivating you to explore new career paths?  

Omar: Well, I’m feeling burnout from the relentless focus on research and publishing. I want a role that’s more balanced, where I can still apply my skills but also have room for other interests. That’s my “call.”  

[09:30] Malik: That’s a powerful motivator. Now, as the hero of your story, what strengths and skills have you gained so far that can serve as your “allies” on this journey?  

Omar: I’d say my analytical skills, experience with AI research, and my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly. Also, my mentorship experience—guiding undergrads and fellow students.  

[09:35] Malik: Perfect. These are your core allies. Now, what’s the “threshold” you need to cross—what fears or doubts are holding you back?  

Omar: Mainly, fear of the unknown and feeling like I might fail if I leave academia. Plus, I worry about job security and whether I can make a successful transition.  

[09:40] Malik: Those are common fears. Remember, stories often involve overcoming obstacles. We can reframe those doubts as challenges you’re prepared to face, equipped with your skills and clarity. Would you like to explore a specific industry or role more deeply now?  

Omar: Yes, I think I want to explore product management in tech companies, especially those working on AI tools. It seems like a good fit because it combines technical knowledge with communication and strategy.  

[09:45] Malik: That’s a compelling direction. Have you done any informational interviews or network research in that area?  

Omar: Not yet, but I’ve been meaning to reach out to some alumni working in tech. I’m a bit nervous about initiating those conversations.  

[09:50] Malik: That’s understandable. We can develop a simple plan for reaching out—draft a message that highlights your interest, your background, and asks for advice. Would you like me to help you craft that now?  

Omar: Yes, please. That would make me feel more confident.  

[09:55] Malik: Great. Let’s start with a brief script: “Hi [Name], I came across your profile and was impressed by your work in AI product management. As a PhD candidate exploring a transition into industry roles, I’d love to hear about your experience and any advice you might have for someone making a similar move.” How does that sound?  

Omar: That’s good, simple but professional. I can personalize it from there.  

[10:00] Malik: Excellent. Remember, framing these conversations as learning opportunities keeps them low-pressure. As you build your network, you’ll gather valuable insights and open doors. Now, thinking about next steps—what actions will you commit to before our next session?  

Omar: I’ll identify three alumni or professionals in AI product management and send them messages. Also, I’ll update my resume to reflect my transferable skills and start drafting a narrative that ties my experience to those roles.  

[10:05] Malik: That’s a strong plan. Keep track of your progress in your reflection journal, and we can review your drafts next time. How are you feeling about everything today?  

Omar: Honestly, a bit more hopeful. Breaking it down like this makes the whole process less overwhelming. I appreciate your help in framing my story and giving me concrete steps.  

[10:10] Malik: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, this is an ongoing journey—each step you take adds to your story. Next session, we can review your outreach and resume, and continue mapping your hero’s journey. Any final questions or thoughts?  

Omar: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Malik. I’ll get to work on those actions.  

[10:15] Malik: Wonderful. Looking forward to hearing about your progress. Have a great week, Omar.  

Omar: Thanks, you too. (smiles softly)
