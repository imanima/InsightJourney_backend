Session 24/24
Date: October 17, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. There’s a lot of uncertainty about my future, and I’m struggling to find clarity.  

09:05  
Malik Johnson: That’s completely understandable, especially given the stage you’re at in your PhD. Let’s start by checking in on your overall mood and any notable shifts since our previous discussion. Did you have any moments of insight or progress?  
Omar: Well, I’ve been doing some reflection exercises you suggested, like journaling my values and strengths. I think I’ve started to see some patterns in what motivates me, but it’s still fuzzy. (pauses) I feel like I’m stuck between finishing my PhD and exploring what’s next.  

09:10  
Malik Johnson: That’s a common experience during transitions—feeling caught between the known and the unknown. Last time, we talked about framing your story around your strengths. Have you had a chance to revisit that story?  
Omar: Yes, I looked at some of my research projects and teaching experiences. I realized I enjoy mentoring students and explaining complex ideas, which makes me feel more confident about potential careers outside academia.  

09:15  
Malik Johnson: That’s a valuable insight. Highlighting your mentoring skills and clarity in communication is a strong narrative thread. How does imagining yourself in a role that emphasizes these strengths feel?  
Omar: It feels promising, actually. I’ve been considering roles like technical trainer, industry consultant, or even a product manager where I can leverage my technical background but also work with people.  

09:20  
Malik Johnson: Excellent. It seems like you’re beginning to craft a story that aligns your academic skills with industry roles. Have you thought about any specific industries or companies that excite you?  
Omar: Not yet in detail, but I’ve started researching AI startups and tech companies that focus on applied machine learning. I’m curious about how my research skills could contribute there.  

09:25  
Malik Johnson: That’s a great starting point. As you explore these options, I recommend creating a map of your transferable skills—research, problem-solving, communication, mentorship—and matching them with industry needs. Would you like to do a quick exercise on that?  
Omar: Sure, that sounds helpful. (leans forward slightly)  

09:30  
Malik Johnson: Wonderful. Think about your experiences—perhaps your recent project on natural language processing—and list the skills you developed. Then, we’ll see how they align with roles in industry.  
Omar: Okay. So, skills like data analysis, writing technical reports, presenting research findings, and mentoring graduate students.  
Malik Johnson: Perfect. Now, consider how these skills translate outside academia. For instance, technical report writing and presenting could be valuable in technical communication or product management. Mentoring and leadership experience could be useful in team lead roles.  
Omar: That makes sense. I hadn’t thought of technical communication or product management before, but they seem relevant.  

09:35  
Malik Johnson: Exactly. Sometimes, reframing your story reveals new pathways. Now, thinking about your network—have you reached out to any industry contacts or done informational interviews?  
Omar: Not yet. I’ve been hesitant because I don’t know where to start or what to ask. I worry about sounding unprepared or bothering people.  

09:40  
Malik Johnson: That’s a common concern. Remember, most people appreciate being asked about their experience and insights. We can prepare some questions together—like asking about their career path, skills they find valuable, or advice for someone transitioning. Would that help?  
Omar: Yes, I think that would make me feel more confident.  

09:45  
Malik Johnson: Great. Let’s outline a few questions now. For example: “Can you tell me about how you transitioned from academia to industry?” or “What skills do you think are most transferable from my background?” How does that sound?  
Omar: That sounds good. I can also ask about industry trends or what challenges they faced during their transition.  

09:50  
Malik Johnson: Excellent. Remember, these conversations will help you gather information and build your network. Over time, they’ll also reinforce your story and boost your confidence. Now, looking at your next steps, what action items feel most manageable for you before our next session?  
Omar: I’ll draft a list of potential contacts and prepare some questions. I’ll also spend some time mapping my transferable skills as we discussed.  

09:55  
Malik Johnson: That’s a solid plan. Let’s also set a goal for you to reach out to at least two contacts this week. How does that sound?  
Omar: That works. I feel a bit more focused now, like I have a clearer direction.  

10:00  
Malik Johnson: Fantastic. Remember, this is a journey, and each step you take builds your story. You’re making meaningful progress. Before we wrap up, any lingering questions or thoughts?  
Omar: Just one—how do I stay motivated when the process feels slow or discouraging?  
Malik Johnson: That’s a great question. It’s important to celebrate small wins and remind yourself of your bigger purpose. Keep your values in mind, and recognize that each step is part of your unique story. I’ll send you some reflection prompts to reinforce that.  

10:05  
Malik Johnson: Well, Omar, I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Our work over these months is shaping a compelling narrative for your future. Looking forward to hearing about your networking efforts!  
Omar: Thanks, Malik. I appreciate your support and guidance. I’ll get started on those action items.  

10:10  
Malik Johnson: Excellent. See you next week, and take care until then!
