09:00 [Start of Session]

Malik: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any new thoughts or feelings about your research or career exploration?  

Omar: Morning, Malik. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more overwhelmed, honestly. The burnout is still there, and I keep questioning if I’m really on the right path. I’ve been doing a lot of reading on industry roles outside academia, but it’s almost paralyzing—so many options and not enough clarity.  

Malik: That’s completely understandable, Omar. Burnout can make everything feel more confusing and overwhelming. It’s good to hear you’re exploring options, though—that’s a strong step. Last time, we talked about your core values and some of the transferable skills you’ve built in your research and teaching roles. How has reflecting on those been for you?  

Omar: I think about that a lot. I realized that I really value problem-solving and innovation—things I’ve done both in my research and teaching. But I still feel stuck connecting those skills to specific careers outside academia. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just idealizing other options without truly understanding what they involve.  

Malik: That’s a very thoughtful insight. It’s normal to feel uncertain when transitioning between worlds, especially when your identity is so intertwined with your academic work. Remember, part of our work is to reframe your story—seeing your skills and experiences not just as academic, but as versatile assets. Have you thought about doing some targeted informational interviews with professionals in fields that interest you?  

Omar: I’ve considered it, but I haven’t reached out yet. I suppose I’m worried about sounding naive or like I don’t have enough understanding.  

Malik: That’s a common concern. Remember, most professionals appreciate genuine curiosity and a desire to learn. It’s about framing your questions around their experiences and insights. For example, you might ask, “What drew you to this career, and what skills do you find most valuable in your day-to-day work?” How does that sound?  

Omar: That sounds doable. I guess I just need to get over the fear of rejection or seeming inexperienced.  

Malik: Absolutely. And remember, every conversation is a learning opportunity, regardless of the outcome. Also, I wonder—have you considered mapping your strengths onto potential industries? We can use a hero journey framework to visualize your story transitioning from academia to industry. Would you like to try that now?  

Omar: Sure, I think that could help.  

[09:10]  

Malik: Great. So, imagine your current academic journey as the 'ordinary world'—your research, teaching, the skills you've developed. Now, think about the 'call to adventure'—the desire to explore new career paths. What would you say is your 'superpower'—the unique strength you bring from your academic experience?  

Omar: I think my ability to analyze complex data and synthesize information quickly. Also, I’m good at problem-solving under pressure.  

Malik: Excellent. Those are powerful skills. Now, as your hero, what are some of the challenges you might face on this new journey?  

Omar: Hmm, maybe feeling like I’m starting over or not being sure if my skills are really transferable. Also, balancing the uncertainty of a new career with my current commitments.  

Malik: Those are valid challenges. But notice—your story isn’t just about uncertainty; it’s about transformation. You have the skills, and now it’s about framing them in a way that aligns with your new goals. How does that perspective sit with you?  

Omar: It’s helpful. It makes me see my transition as part of a larger story of growth, not just a crisis.  

Malik: Exactly. And as you continue to craft this narrative, I suggest you start a digital reflection journal. Write about your strengths, insights from informational interviews, and how your story is evolving. This can reinforce your sense of agency.  

Omar: That sounds good. I’ll try that. I think writing it out might make it feel more real and manageable.  

[09:20]  

Malik: Good. Now, let’s revisit your skills inventory. You mentioned problem-solving and data analysis. Can you identify some specific transferable skills that you could highlight on a resume or LinkedIn profile?  

Omar: Sure. I’ve led data analysis projects, mentored undergraduates in research, and presented at conferences. I think I can frame these experiences to show leadership, communication, and technical expertise.  

Malik: Perfect. Those are compelling. When you craft your narrative, think of yourself as the hero who has developed a versatile toolkit—these skills can open doors in many fields like tech, consulting, or data-driven roles in industry.  

Omar: That’s a good way to look at it. I guess I need to stop thinking of my skills as solely academic and see them as more universal.  

Malik: Exactly. It’s about story reframing—seeing your journey as a hero’s journey, full of growth and new opportunities. Now, as homework before our next session, I’d like you to reach out to at least two professionals in fields you’re curious about. Prepare some questions, and reflect on what you learn. We can review your experiences next time.  

Omar: I’ll do that. Thanks, Malik. I feel a bit more hopeful now, like I have a direction to start moving in.  

Malik: That’s wonderful to hear, Omar. Remember, your story is ongoing, and each step adds to your narrative of growth. I look forward to hearing about your conversations. Anything else you want to touch on today?  

Omar: No, I think that covers it for now. Thanks again.  

Malik: My pleasure. See you next week, Omar. Keep your story moving forward.
