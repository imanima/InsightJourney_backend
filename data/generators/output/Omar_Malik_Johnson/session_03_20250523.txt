Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

**[09:00] Malik:** Good morning, Omar. It’s great to see you again. How are you feeling today?

**[09:02] Omar:** Hi Malik. I’m feeling a bit more grounded than last week, actually. Still some uncertainty, but definitely more clarity on what I want to explore.

**[09:04] Malik:** That’s good to hear. Last time, we touched on your feelings of burnout and your doubts about your future career. Have you had a chance to reflect on some of the stories we discussed?

**[09:07] Omar:** Yes, I spent some time journaling and trying to reframe my narrative around my PhD experience. Instead of seeing it as just exhaustion, I started viewing it as a period of intense growth and skill development.

**[09:09] Malik:** That’s a powerful shift. How does that new story sit with you?

**[09:11] Omar:** It feels more empowering, honestly. Like I’m recognizing my resilience rather than just feeling drained all the time.

**[09:13] Malik:** Excellent. Remember, stories are malleable; they shape how we see ourselves and our options. Today, I’d like us to focus on exploring potential career paths that align with these strengths and stories you’re crafting. Have you thought more about industries or roles outside academia?

**[09:15] Omar:** I have. I’ve been considering tech industry roles, maybe data science or AI product management. I’m curious about how my research skills could transfer there.

**[09:17] Malik:** Great. Let’s do a quick strengths assessment. What skills do you feel are your top transferable assets?

**[09:19] Omar:** Well, I’m pretty proficient in data analysis, programming, and research methodology. Also, I’ve developed strong problem-solving skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas, especially through teaching.

**[09:21] Malik:** Those are valuable. Think of your strengths as a hero’s toolkit. How might these skills help you in a tech role like data science or product management?

**[09:23] Omar:** In data science, I can leverage my programming and analysis skills to interpret data and build models. For product management, my experience explaining complex ideas to others and managing projects could be useful.

**[09:25] Malik:** Exactly. And notice how your story of resilience and growth feeds into this. You’ve been navigating complex problems, which is central to many tech roles. Now, let’s map out some potential career stories or “hero journeys” that resonate with these paths.

**[09:27] Omar:** Okay. So, I’d be the hero who transitions from academic researcher to innovative problem-solver in industry, applying my skills to real-world challenges.

**[09:29] Malik:** That’s a compelling narrative. How does that story resonate with your values and sense of purpose?

**[09:31] Omar:** I value solving meaningful problems and applying knowledge practically. Moving into industry seems aligned with that, especially if I can work on AI projects that have a tangible impact.

**[09:33] Malik:** Perfect. That clarity can serve as a guiding star. Now, I want us to consider some concrete next steps. Have you thought about informational interviews or networking in those industries?

**[09:35] Omar:** Yes, I’ve been looking at LinkedIn and researching contacts in AI startups and tech companies. I feel a bit nervous reaching out, though.

**[09:37] Malik:** That’s normal. Building your network can feel intimidating at first. Let’s brainstorm some ways to approach these conversations that feel authentic and aligned with your story.

**[09:39] Omar:** Maybe I can share my story—how I’ve developed skills through my PhD and how I want to apply them outside academia. Framing it as a quest for meaningful work.

**[09:41] Malik:** Beautiful. That narrative of seeking meaningful impact can be very engaging. When you reach out, emphasizing your strengths and your story can foster genuine connections.

**[09:43] Omar:** That makes sense. I’ll draft some messages today. Should I also start thinking about updating my resume?

**[09:45] Malik:** Absolutely. Tailoring your resume to highlight relevant skills—like data analysis, problem-solving, and project management—will support your story. Also, consider creating a digital portfolio or reflection journal that documents your journey and skills development.

**[09:47] Omar:** I like that idea. It would help me see my progress and reinforce my narrative.

**[09:49] Malik:** Great. Now, reflecting on our previous sessions, how do you feel your story has evolved since we started working together?

**[09:51] Omar:** I think I’m starting to see my PhD experience as a foundation rather than an endpoint. I feel more confident about exploring options beyond academia.

**[09:53] Malik:** That’s a significant shift. Recognizing your story as a foundation opens up many possibilities. For next week, I’d like you to continue these reflections, maybe even sketch out a “hero’s journey” for your career transition.

**[09:55] Omar:** Will do. I’ll also reach out to at least two contacts this week and update my resume.

**[09:57] Malik:** Excellent action steps. Remember, your story is powerful, and you’re the hero in this journey. We’ll continue to refine your narrative and explore your options. Any last questions or thoughts before we wrap up today?

**[09:59] Omar:** No, I think that covers everything. Thanks, Malik. This session really helps me see things more clearly.

**[10:00] Malik:** My pleasure, Omar. Looking forward to hearing about your networking efforts next week. Have a great week, and keep embracing your story.

**[10:02] Omar:** Thanks, you too. Bye!

**[10:03] Malik:** Goodbye.
