Session 4/24
Date: May 30, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[09:02] Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster—some days are good, others I feel more overwhelmed with the uncertainty about my future.

[09:05] Malik: That’s understandable, especially given the intense nature of your PhD work. Last time, we touched on your strengths and explored some of your core values. How have those reflections been influencing your thinking this week?

[09:07] Omar: I’ve been thinking a lot about my skills, especially my technical abilities in AI and data analysis. I realize I’ve developed quite a bit, but I’m still unsure how to translate that into a broader career outside academia.

[09:10] Malik: That’s a valuable insight. Let’s revisit your story—what’s been your narrative so far, and how might we reframe it to include these transferable skills? Remember, your story isn’t just about academia; it’s about your journey of discovery and growth.

[09:12] Omar: Yeah, I tend to see myself as just a researcher right now. But I guess I’ve also learned project management, teamwork, problem-solving—things that could apply elsewhere.

[09:15] Malik: Exactly. And that’s a great starting point. How about we map out a hero’s journey for you—identify the challenges you’ve faced, the skills you’ve gained, and the 'call to adventure' outside academia? Would that help you see your story differently?

[09:18] Omar: I like that idea. It might make my experience feel more complete, like I’m not just stuck in one role but on a larger quest.

[09:20] Malik: Perfect. Let’s take a moment to sketch that out. (leans in slightly) Think about your recent challenges—burnout, balancing research and personal life—and how you overcame or managed them. These are your trials and triumphs.

[09:23] Omar: Well, managing research deadlines while feeling exhausted was tough. But I developed a routine—scheduled breaks, prioritized tasks, and reached out to peers for support. That helped me stay afloat.

[09:26] Malik: That’s a hero’s act—facing exhaustion, seeking support, and finding resilience. Now, considering your skills—what strengths did you activate during those times?

[09:28] Omar: Definitely perseverance, adaptability, and technical expertise. I also learned to communicate better with my advisors and peers.

[09:30] Malik: Great. So, if we think of your narrative as a story of resilience and growth, how might that inform your future career path? Are there sectors or roles where these strengths are especially valued?

[09:33] Omar: I suppose industries like tech consulting, AI ethics, or even data-driven product management could be options. They value problem-solving, communication, and adaptability.

[09:36] Malik: Excellent possibilities. Have you done any industry research or informational interviews in those areas?

[09:38] Omar: Not yet, but I’ve been meaning to reach out to some alumni working in AI startups and tech firms. I’m a bit nervous about that, though.

[09:41] Malik: That’s a common feeling. Would it help to prepare a narrative about your story—your strengths, experiences, and what you’re seeking? This can boost your confidence in reaching out.

[09:44] Omar: Yes, that makes sense. I think framing my story as someone with a strong technical background and a passion for applying AI ethically could resonate well.

[09:47] Malik: Definitely. Also, remember, networking is a two-way street. You’re offering valuable insights and skills, and they can provide guidance and opportunities. When you think about your next steps, how might you structure your outreach?

[09:50] Omar: I’ll draft a short message introducing myself, sharing my background, and expressing genuine interest in their work. Then, I’ll ask if they’d be open to a quick chat or coffee.

[09:52] Malik: That sounds like a solid plan. Would you like to role-play that message now, or draft it for homework?

[09:55] Omar: I think I’ll try drafting it after this session. It feels more real if I do it on my own first.

[09:57] Malik: Good idea. Now, reflecting on your goals—finding clarity around your career direction and building a network—what is your biggest challenge right now?

[10:00] Omar: Probably overcoming the self-doubt about leaving academia. I worry that I might not succeed in other fields or that I’ll miss the academic environment too much.

[10:03] Malik: That’s a common concern. Remember, your story isn’t about leaving behind who you are but about expanding your narrative. Your skills and experiences are assets, regardless of the setting.

[10:05] Omar: I see what you mean. Framing it that way helps me feel a bit more confident about exploring new options.

[10:07] Malik: Wonderful. As a next step, let’s identify three specific actions you’ll take before our next session. What comes to mind?

[10:10] Omar: First, I’ll complete a list of my transferable skills and strengths. Second, I’ll reach out to at least two alumni or professionals in my target industries. Third, I’ll start a reflection journal to track my feelings and insights during this process.

[10:12] Malik: Excellent. Having those concrete steps will keep you moving forward. And during the week, I encourage you to revisit your hero’s journey map and see how your story continues to evolve.

[10:15] Omar: Will do. Thanks, Malik. This session helped me see my story in a new light.

[10:17] Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Omar. Remember, your journey is unique and valuable. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week.

[10:20] Omar: Me too. Thanks again. Have a good week!

[10:22] Malik: You’re welcome. Take care, Omar. See you next week.
