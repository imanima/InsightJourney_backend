[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar! It's great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
[09:02] Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’m a bit tired but honestly relieved to be back. I’ve been thinking a lot about our last conversation and trying to process everything.  
[09:05] Malik: That’s completely understandable. Last time, we touched on your feelings of burnout and some uncertainty about your career path. Have you had any new insights or reflections since then?  
[09:07] Omar: Yeah, I’ve been trying to step back a bit and look at my story more objectively. I realized I tend to focus a lot on perfection and achievement, but I haven't really thought about what *drives* me beyond that.  
[09:10] Malik: That's a valuable observation. Sometimes, understanding what truly motivates us helps clarify the bigger picture. Have you identified any specific moments in your academic journey that felt particularly meaningful or energizing?  
[09:13] Omar: Hmm… I think I really enjoyed the collaborative projects during my research assistantship. Working with others, sharing ideas, solving problems together—those moments felt more alive than the solitary work I often do for my papers.  
[09:16] Malik: That’s a great insight. It suggests that collaboration and connection may be central to what sustains you. Would you say that working alone on data analysis or writing is more draining for you?  
[09:19] Omar: Yes, definitely. I get absorbed in details but sometimes lose sight of the bigger purpose. When I collaborate, I feel more engaged and motivated.  
[09:22] Malik: Excellent. This aligns with a narrative perspective—your story highlights moments of connection that give it meaning. Now, considering your goal to explore potential career options, have you thought about roles that emphasize collaboration or community?  
[09:25] Omar: I have. I’ve been looking into industry roles like AI research teams, or even tech companies that focus on social impact. But I’m also curious about academic paths outside of my current university, maybe interdisciplinary work.  
[09:28] Malik: That’s a broad and exciting exploration. Let’s do a quick strengths assessment based on what you’ve shared so far. Besides collaboration, what other skills or qualities do you see in yourself?  
[09:31] Omar: Well, I think I’m good at analytical thinking and problem-solving. Also, I’m pretty persistent—sometimes to a fault—but I don’t give up easily.  
[09:34] Malik: Those are powerful strengths. Analytical skills and persistence are highly valued across many industries. Now, considering your narrative, how might these strengths help you craft a story of your future career?  
[09:37] Omar: Hmm… I guess I could see myself as someone who uses deep analysis to develop innovative AI solutions, and my persistence helps me see projects through, especially when things get complicated.  
[09:40] Malik: That’s a compelling hero’s journey. You’re the researcher who overcomes challenges through persistence and analytical mastery. Now, let's think about your values—what matters most to you beyond professional success?  
[09:43] Omar: Family is important, and I really want my work to have a positive impact on society. I want my career to be meaningful, not just about titles or salary.  
[09:46] Malik: Those are powerful guiding principles. Values like societal impact and family can serve as anchors as you navigate your career. Now, how does this story of innovation, persistence, and impact resonate with your current feelings of burnout?  
[09:49] Omar: I think focusing on these values might help me find a purpose again. Instead of just pushing through, I can seek roles that align with what truly matters to me.  
[09:52] Malik: Exactly. Reframing your story around these strengths and values can be a source of motivation and clarity. As we move forward, I’d like you to start a reflection journal—perhaps daily or weekly—that captures moments when you feel energized or connected to your purpose.  
[09:55] Omar: That sounds helpful. I tend to forget the good parts when I get overwhelmed.  
[09:58] Malik: It’s common, but capturing those moments can reinforce your narrative of resilience and purpose. For our next session, I’d like you to identify one or two potential career paths that excite you and do some initial research on what skills or experiences they require.  
[10:00] Omar: Will do. I’ll also reach out to a couple of contacts I have in industry to set up informational interviews.  
[10:02] Malik: Great initiative. Remember, your story is your strength. We’ll continue shaping it to support your transition. Before we wrap up today, do you have any questions or thoughts?  
[10:05] Omar: Just that I feel more hopeful already. It’s good to see how my story can guide me rather than hold me back.  
[10:07] Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Keep that hope alive, and I look forward to hearing about your discoveries next week. Our next session is scheduled for the same time next Monday.  
[10:10] Omar: Thanks, Malik. See you next week.
