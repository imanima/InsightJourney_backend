Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 [09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How are you feeling today?

Omar: Hi Malik. I’m doing okay, thanks. A bit tired, honestly. The research has been intense lately, but I’m glad to be here.

Malik: I hear you. Research burnout is real, especially when you're pushing hard. Let’s start by briefly revisiting your recent experiences—what’s been on your mind since our last session?

Omar: Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want after my PhD. I’ve explored some industry options, but I still feel a bit unsure. I’m also trying to balance my work and personal life, but it’s been challenging.

Malik: That’s understandable. You mentioned last time feeling uncertain about your career direction. Have your thoughts shifted since then?

Omar: Slightly. I’ve done some research into different fields—AI startups, tech consulting, even data science roles outside academia. I think I’m leaning toward industry, but I’m worried about losing the academic identity I’ve built.

Malik: That’s a common concern. Transitioning identity can feel daunting. Let’s explore your story around your academic journey—what parts of it feel most meaningful to you?

Omar: (pauses thoughtfully) I’d say the problem-solving aspect. I love tackling complex issues, breaking them down, and finding solutions. That’s what drew me into AI research initially.

Malik: That’s a strong thread. It sounds like your core strength is your analytical mindset and love for problem-solving. How might these skills translate into other careers outside academia?

Omar: I guess in data analytics or AI consulting. Those roles involve similar skills—analyzing data, building models, advising clients.

Malik: Exactly. And by framing your story around that, you can see your transferable strengths clearly. Remember, your narrative isn’t just about what you’ve done but what you excel at and enjoy. How does that resonate with your view of yourself?

Omar: It makes sense. I think I’ve been so focused on academic achievements that I haven’t given enough weight to what I really enjoy and excel at.

Malik: That’s a valuable insight. Now, considering your interest in industry, what specific roles or sectors excite you the most?

Omar: I’ve been looking into AI product development and perhaps roles in tech companies that focus on machine learning applications. I find the idea of creating real-world solutions very appealing.

Malik: Great. And how about the skills you’re developing now—what do you see as your strongest assets for those roles?

Omar: My technical skills, definitely. Programming, data analysis, model building. But also my experience teaching and communicating complex ideas, which I think is valuable.

Malik: Communication is a crucial skill, especially when translating technical work to stakeholders. Now, let’s do a quick strengths story. Can you recall a time when you solved a challenging problem in your research that made you feel proud?

Omar: (smiles) Yes. During my last project, I developed a novel algorithm to optimize data processing, which improved efficiency by 20%. It was a complex challenge, but I enjoyed the process of experimenting and refining.

Malik: That’s a powerful story. You can see yourself as someone who thrives on innovation and problem-solving. How might you frame this story for your future career narrative?

Omar: I suppose I could say that I’m someone who creates solutions—innovative, efficient, and adaptable—qualities that are valuable in industry roles.

Malik: Absolutely. Framing your story this way emphasizes your strengths and aligns with your career goals. Moving forward, I’d like us to map out potential pathways based on these stories and skills. How does that sound?

Omar: That sounds helpful. I want to get a clearer picture of where I can go.

Malik: Perfect. Before we dive into mapping, how are you feeling about your work-life balance lately?

Omar: Honestly, still struggling a bit. I work late into the night, and I’m often anxious about deadlines. It’s hard to switch off.

Malik: That’s understandable, given the workload. Let’s consider some strategies to manage this—perhaps setting boundaries or scheduling dedicated downtime. But first, let’s revisit your values—what matters most to you outside of your academic pursuits?

Omar: I value curiosity, growth, and meaningful contribution. I want my work to matter and to keep learning new things.

Malik: Those are powerful values. And aligning your career transition with them will ensure greater fulfillment. For example, roles in industry that involve ongoing learning and impactful projects could be a good fit.

Omar: Yes, I think I’d find that satisfying.

Malik: Great. To summarize today’s work, we’ve identified your core strengths through your story, explored potential career paths that align with those strengths and values, and acknowledged the importance of work-life balance. Next time, we can focus on specific action steps—like updating your resume, preparing for informational interviews, or building your network.

Omar: That sounds good. I feel more confident about framing my story now.

Malik: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, your story is a powerful tool. Keep reflecting on these narratives, and we’ll continue to refine your path. Any final questions before we end today?

Omar: Not right now. Thanks, Malik. This session helped me see things more clearly.

Malik: Excellent. I’ll send you some reflection prompts and a career mapping template to work on before our next session. Keep noting your thoughts and any new insights. Looking forward to our next meeting.

Omar: Thanks again. See you next week.

Malik: Take care, Omar.
