Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00 [09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the options I’ve been exploring lately.  
Malik: That’s understandable, especially given how much ground you’ve covered since we started. Let’s take a moment to reflect—what’s been standing out to you recently?  

09:10 [09:10] Omar: Well, I spent some time doing that strengths assessment you suggested, and I realized I’m really good at analytical thinking and problem-solving. I also enjoy mentoring students and explaining complex concepts.  
Malik: That’s a strong set of skills. You mentioned mentoring—how does that make you feel? Do you see that as part of your future?  
Omar: I do, but I’m not sure if I want to keep it as just a side activity or turn it into something more professional. I guess I’m still figuring out what kind of career would fully utilize those strengths.  

09:20 [09:20] Malik: That’s an important distinction. When you think about your long-term goals, what kind of work environment or role feels most aligned with your values and interests?  
Omar: I value intellectual challenge and meaningful impact. I want to work on projects that contribute to real-world applications, maybe in AI for social good or healthcare. But I also worry about job stability and work-life balance.  

09:30 [09:30] Malik: Those are valid concerns. It’s good that you’re aware of what matters most to you. Last time, we touched on mapping your career story. Have you thought more about how your PhD journey could be reframed as a hero’s journey?  
Omar: Yes, I’ve tried to see my research as a quest—overcoming obstacles, acquiring knowledge, and now facing the uncertainty of what’s next. But sometimes I feel like I’m stuck in the ‘deep cave’ part, unsure of the exit.  

09:40 [09:40] Malik: That’s a common feeling in transition phases. Remember, the hero’s journey recognizes that setbacks are part of growth. What would the ‘return’ or new beginning look like for you? Maybe exploring different industries or roles?  
Omar: Exactly. I’ve started researching careers outside academia—like data science roles in tech companies, or research positions in healthcare startups. But I’m not sure how my skills translate or how to make that leap.  

09:50 [09:50] Malik: That’s a great start. Let’s consider your transferable skills—problem-solving, data analysis, mentoring—and how they align with those careers. Have you thought about reaching out to professionals in those fields for informational interviews?  
Omar: I’ve thought about it, but I haven’t taken action yet. I feel a bit nervous about approaching strangers, even if I know it’s a good way to learn more.  

10:00 [10:00] Malik: That’s normal. Building a network takes courage, but it’s also about storytelling—sharing your journey and interests authentically. Perhaps drafting a brief introduction or questions could make those conversations easier. Would you like to do a quick role-play now?  
Omar: Sure, that might help.  

(They proceed with a role-play where Malik models reaching out to a professional in AI healthcare, and Omar practices crafting his message.)  

10:10 [10:10] Malik: Excellent. Now, I want you to think about what specific skills or experiences you can highlight in your resume or LinkedIn profile to appeal to those roles. Have you started updating your documents?  
Omar: I’ve updated my CV a bit, focusing on my research projects, but I haven’t tailored it for industry roles yet. I’m not sure what to emphasize besides my technical skills.  

10:20 [10:20] Malik: That’s a good start. Remember to frame your research as problem-solving and innovation—qualities valued in many industries. Also, consider adding a ‘Skills & Transferable Talents’ section that highlights mentorship, teamwork, and communication. Would you like me to review your draft later?  
Omar: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to make sure it aligns with the kind of roles I’m interested in.  

10:30 [10:30] Malik: Perfect. Before we wrap up, let’s revisit your values. You mentioned impact and stability—are there specific organizations or sectors that resonate with those?  
Omar: I’ve been looking into nonprofits that focus on AI for social good, as well as companies working on healthcare innovations. I think aligning with organizations that have a clear mission could give me a sense of purpose.  

10:40 [10:40] Malik: That’s a strong direction. Remember, your story is about a researcher committed to making a difference. Framing your experience around that purpose will make your narrative compelling. For next time, I’d like you to reach out to at least two professionals in those sectors and reflect on those conversations.  
Omar: I can do that. It feels good to have clearer steps now.  

10:50 [10:50] Malik: Great. And any lingering doubts or feelings you want to share before we end today?  
Omar: I think I’m mostly relieved. It’s reassuring to have a plan and some concrete actions. I still feel a bit anxious about the transition, but I’m more confident about taking the next steps.  

11:00 [11:00] Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, transitions are journeys, not destinations. You’re making meaningful progress. For next session, we’ll review your networking efforts and refine your career mapping further. Keep reflecting on your story and values.  
Omar: Will do. Thanks, Malik. See you next week.
