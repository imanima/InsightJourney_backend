Session 7/24
Date: June 20, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik: Good morning, Omar. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay. Fairly busy with my research, but honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, especially with trying to balance everything.  

09:10  
Malik: That’s understandable, especially with the intensity of a PhD program. When you say overwhelmed, can you tell me more about what’s been most challenging for you this week?  
Omar: Well, I think it’s the constant pressure to perform perfectly. I’ve been working long hours on my experiments, and I keep second-guessing myself about whether I’m heading in the right direction. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck in a loop of self-doubt.  

09:20  
Malik: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like perfectionism and self-doubt are weighing on you. Last time, we worked on identifying your core values and strengths. How has that been for you?  
Omar: I’ve been reflecting on that. It helped me realize that I value curiosity and innovation — those are what drive me. But I still struggle with feeling like I need to prove myself constantly, which sometimes clashes with my values.  

09:30  
Malik: That’s a powerful insight. When your values and your perfectionist tendencies seem to clash, it can create internal tension. Do you recall our earlier work on your hero’s journey map? Have you thought about your research or academic challenges as part of that narrative?  
Omar: Yeah, I’ve thought about it. I guess I see myself as in the “crossroads” stage, trying to decide whether to push forward or pivot to something else. Sometimes I wonder if I should see this as a heroic quest for knowledge, or if I should start exploring other paths.  

09:40  
Malik: That’s a very rich perspective. Viewing your journey as a hero’s quest can help reframe your experience — focusing on growth and discovery rather than solely on outcomes. Have you considered what other “paths” might look like for you?  
Omar: Honestly, I’ve been curious about industry roles in AI, maybe moving into tech companies or startups. But I worry about leaving the academic world behind, especially since I’ve invested so much. It’s intimidating to think about changing directions.  

09:50  
Malik: That’s a common concern. Transitioning from academia to industry is a significant step, but it also aligns with your curiosity and desire for real-world impact. Have you identified any transferable skills from your research and teaching experience?  
Omar: I think I’ve developed strong analytical skills, project management, and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly. Also, I’ve learned to collaborate with diverse teams, which seems valuable in many industries.  

10:00  
Malik: Excellent. Those skills are highly transferable. Let’s take a moment to map out your strengths and how they connect to potential career options. (Malik opens a Miro board with a strengths map) Would you like to start?  
Omar: Sure. I’d say my curiosity and analytical thinking are my top strengths. I also consider myself persistent and detail-oriented.  

10:10  
Malik: Great. Now, considering those, which industries or roles do you feel could benefit from these traits?  
Omar: Maybe data science or AI product management. I’ve also thought about consulting, where problem-solving is key.  

10:20  
Malik: Those are promising options. What steps do you think you’d need to take to explore these roles further?  
Omar: I guess I should start networking with professionals in those fields, maybe attend some industry events or reach out for informational interviews. Also, I could look into certifications or online courses to build relevant skills.  

10:30  
Malik: That’s a solid plan. Building your network is crucial. Who in your current academic or professional circle could help you connect with industry folks?  
Omar: I have some contacts from conferences and my research collaborations. I could reach out to my mentor or colleagues who have industry experience.  

10:40  
Malik: Excellent. Let’s also think about framing your story for these networking conversations. How might you introduce your background in a way that highlights your transferable skills and curiosity?  
Omar: I think I could say, “I’m a PhD candidate in AI with experience in research and teaching, passionate about applying my analytical and problem-solving skills to real-world challenges in industry.”  

10:50  
Malik: Perfect. That’s clear and compelling. As we wrap up today’s session, what specific actions will you commit to before our next meeting?  
Omar: I’ll draft a list of contacts to reach out to for informational interviews, and I’ll look into some industry-focused courses. I’ll also spend some time revisiting my hero’s journey map to keep exploring my narrative.  

11:00  
Malik: Sounds like a great plan. Remember, your story is dynamic, and each step you take adds new depth to it. We’ll review your progress next time and explore any new insights. How are you feeling about the path forward?  
Omar: I feel more focused and hopeful. It’s helpful to see my skills and interests laid out like this. Thanks, Malik.  

11:10  
Malik: You’re very welcome. I’m glad to hear that. Keep reflecting on your values and strengths, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. See you next week!  
Omar: Thanks again. See you next week.
