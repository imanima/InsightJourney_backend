Session 6/24
Date: June 13, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything—balancing research, trying to figure out my next steps, and dealing with some burnout.  

09:05  
Malik Johnson: That sounds like a lot to juggle. It’s completely understandable, especially given how demanding PhD work can be. Last time, we talked about some of your core values and strengths, and I wonder—have you had a chance to reflect on how those might inform your future career options?  

Omar: Yes, I did some reflection. I realized I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect of my research, but I also want to find a way to apply those skills outside academia, maybe in industry or something more innovative.  

09:10  
Malik Johnson: That’s a great insight. Recognizing that you want to harness your problem-solving skills in new contexts is a valuable step. Remember our hero journey mapping? Have you thought about what your “call to adventure” might look like outside academia?  

Omar (smiling slightly): I guess it would be exploring roles in tech companies, maybe in AI development or data science. I’ve started researching companies and some industry roles that align with my skills.  

09:15  
Malik Johnson: Excellent. Have you found any specific companies or roles that excite you?  

Omar: Yeah, I’ve looked into some startups and bigger firms like Google and OpenAI. They seem to value innovative AI research and practical applications, which appeals to me. But I feel a bit hesitant—like I’m not sure if I have enough experience outside of research to make that switch smoothly.  

09:20  
Malik Johnson: That’s a common concern. Let's explore that. What transferable skills do you think you’ve developed during your PhD and research assistant roles?  

Omar: Well, I’m good at analyzing complex data, developing algorithms, and communicating technical ideas. I’ve also learned how to work independently and manage projects.  

09:25  
Malik Johnson: Those are excellent transferable skills. Think of them as your hero’s toolkit—powerful tools that can be applied in many contexts. Have you considered tailoring your CV or resume to highlight these skills for industry roles?  

Omar: I’ve started updating my CV, focusing more on technical skills and project outcomes. But I’m not sure if I’m framing them effectively for industry recruiters.  

09:30  
Malik Johnson: That’s an important step. We can do a quick strengths storytelling exercise now—try framing one of your research projects as a hero’s journey. For example, what was the initial challenge, your approach, and the outcome?  

Omar (thinking): Okay. One project involved developing a machine learning model to improve data classification accuracy. The challenge was handling noisy datasets; I designed an algorithm that increased accuracy by 15%. It felt like overcoming a significant obstacle.  

09:35  
Malik Johnson: Perfect. Framing it that way highlights your problem-solving hero overcoming a challenge. This narrative can be very compelling on resumes or LinkedIn profiles. Speaking of networking, have you started building or engaging with professional contacts in industry?  

Omar: Not much yet. I’ve been mostly focused on my research, but I know I should start reaching out. I’ve been hesitant about cold messaging professionals, though.  

09:40  
Malik Johnson: That’s understandable. Networking can feel daunting, but it’s a key part of career transition. Think of it as building your ally network for your hero’s journey. Would you be comfortable drafting a brief message now to someone in your target industry?  

Omar: Yeah, I can try. Maybe reaching out to someone I found on LinkedIn who works in AI product development.  

09:45  
Malik Johnson: Great idea. Remember to personalize your message—mention shared interests or projects. Also, be clear about what you’re seeking—advice, informational interview, or insights. Would you like me to help craft a draft?  

Omar: That would be helpful. Thanks.  

[Malik and Omar work together briefly on a draft message.]  

09:50  
Malik Johnson: Excellent. Now, looking at your overall plan—what do you feel is your next immediate step?  

Omar: I think I’ll reach out to that contact and also spend some time refining my resume with the stories we discussed. I’d like to start exploring more industry-specific skills and maybe take some online courses.  

09:55  
Malik Johnson: Those are strong next steps. Also, let’s revisit your values—what do you want your next career to fulfill for you personally?  

Omar: I want to feel like I’m making a tangible impact, working on innovative technology that can help people. Also, I value work-life balance and personal growth.  

10:00  
Malik Johnson: That clarity is powerful. Aligning your career steps with those values will bring more fulfillment. As we wrap up today, let’s set some action items. You’ll send that outreach message, update your resume using the storytelling framework, and identify one online course to bolster your industry skills.  

Omar: Sounds good. I feel more focused already. Thanks, Malik.  

Malik Johnson: You’re making great progress, Omar. Remember, this journey is about your story—each step is a chapter. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll check on how your outreach goes and explore your reflections on this process.  

Omar: Looking forward to it. Thanks again.
