Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

09:00  
Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks, I’ve been alright, I guess. Still feeling a bit overwhelmed, but I’ve started to think more about what I want to do after my PhD.  

09:05  
Malik Johnson: That’s a positive step. Remember last time, we discussed your core values and how they might influence your career choices? Have you had any new insights or reflections since then?  
Omar: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that a lot. I realized that curiosity and intellectual growth are really important to me. I also value work that feels meaningful, not just technically challenging.  

09:10  
Malik Johnson: That’s a powerful realization. So, your curiosity and sense of purpose are central to how you want to shape your career. Have you looked into any industries or roles outside academia where those values could be fulfilled?  
Omar: I’ve been researching some tech companies, especially those focused on AI ethics and responsible AI. It feels aligned with my interest in meaningful work, but I’m not sure how transferable my skills are.  

09:15  
Malik Johnson: That’s a great start. Let’s explore the skills you've developed during your PhD and research work—what do you see as your core strengths?  
Omar: Well, I’m good at data analysis, programming, and problem-solving. I also have experience presenting complex ideas clearly, especially through papers and seminars. Plus, I’ve learned how to collaborate in research teams.  

09:20  
Malik Johnson: Excellent. These are highly valued skills in many industries, especially in AI-related fields. Have you tried framing these skills as a narrative—your story of growth and expertise?  
Omar: Not really. I tend to focus on the technical side, but I haven’t thought much about how to tell my story to someone outside academia.  

09:25  
Malik Johnson: That’s understandable. Let’s do a quick exercise. Imagine your career as a hero’s journey. How would you describe your story so far? What challenges have you overcome, and what drives you forward?  
Omar (pausing thoughtfully): Hmm. I’d say I started with a strong curiosity about AI, which led me to pursue my PhD. The journey has been tough—burnout, imposter syndrome—and sometimes I wonder if I’m on the right path. But my desire to contribute to ethical AI keeps me motivated.  

09:30  
Malik Johnson: That’s a compelling narrative. You’ve faced challenges, but your purpose — contributing ethically — is a strong motivator. How might you reframe these struggles as part of your hero’s growth?  
Omar: Maybe I can see burnout as a signal that I need better balance or new perspectives, not just a failure. It’s part of my learning journey.  

09:35  
Malik Johnson: Exactly. Recognizing struggles as growth opportunities helps build resilience. Now, considering your interest in tech companies and AI ethics, what steps could you take to explore this path further?  
Omar: I suppose I could reach out to some alumni working in those fields, or look for informational interviews. Maybe also start tailoring my CV to highlight transferable skills like problem-solving and project management.  

09:40  
Malik Johnson: Those are excellent ideas. Have you identified any potential contacts or networks you could approach?  
Omar: I have a few contacts from conferences and LinkedIn, but I haven’t reached out yet. I’m a bit nervous about that.  

09:45  
Malik Johnson: That’s natural. Let’s plan a small, manageable step. Would you like me to help you draft an outreach message? We can also discuss how to prepare for those conversations.  
Omar: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to make a good impression and show how my skills are relevant.  

09:50  
Malik Johnson: Great. Let’s look at framing your message around your strengths and your genuine interest in ethical AI. Remember, these conversations are as much about learning as about networking.  
Omar: Thanks. I think I can do that. Also, I’ve been trying to keep a journal of my daily reflections. It helps me process my feelings about burnout and progress.  

09:55  
Malik Johnson: That’s an excellent practice. Reflection is key to understanding your internal landscape. How has this journaling impacted your self-awareness?  
Omar: It’s helped me see patterns — like when I’m most productive and when I start feeling overwhelmed. It also reminds me of my motivations, which keeps me going.  

10:00  
Malik Johnson: Wonderful. It sounds like you’re making meaningful progress in understanding your internal narrative and how it relates to your external actions. For our next steps, I’d like you to identify three specific contacts for informational interviews and draft your outreach messages. How does that sound?  
Omar: That sounds good. I’ll do that. Should I also continue journaling?  
Malik Johnson: Absolutely. Keep using your journal as a tool for reflection. And next time, we can review your outreach drafts and discuss any insights from your conversations.  

10:05  
Omar: Thanks, Malik. I feel more focused now. It’s helpful to see my story and skills in a new light.  
Malik Johnson: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, your story is a powerful tool—use it to open doors and build your confidence. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week.  
Omar: Me too. Thanks again.  

10:10  
Malik Johnson: You’re welcome. Have a great week, Omar. Talk soon!
