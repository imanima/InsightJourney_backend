Session 14/24
Date: August 08, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any reflections or new insights you'd like to share?

[09:05] Omar: Hi Malik. Thanks. I’ve been thinking a lot about the career options we discussed last time. I’m feeling a bit more clarity, but also some uncertainty. It’s like I have a few paths in mind, but I’m not sure which one aligns best with my strengths and values.

[09:07] Malik: That’s completely normal, Omar. Navigating uncertainty is part of the process. Let’s start by revisiting the strengths assessment you did last week. Have you had a chance to reflect on which skills you feel most confident about?

[09:10] Omar: Yes, I think my main strengths are problem-solving, analytical thinking, and my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly—especially in writing. I also realized I enjoy mentoring, which I hadn’t considered as much before.

[09:12] Malik: Excellent. Those are valuable skills across many fields. You mentioned mentoring—can you tell me more about when you’ve enjoyed mentoring others, perhaps during your research or teaching assistant roles?

[09:15] Omar: Sure. During my TA sessions, I liked helping undergrads understand difficult concepts. And I’ve mentored some newer lab members, which felt fulfilling. It’s the part of my work where I feel most engaged.

[09:17] Malik: That’s a great insight. It suggests that mentorship and knowledge sharing are important to you. Now, thinking about your broader career options, what industries or roles are you considering outside academia?

[09:20] Omar: Well, I’ve looked into tech companies, especially those working on AI applications. I’m also curious about research roles in industry, maybe at a startup or a larger corporation. But I worry about the culture fit and work-life balance.

[09:23] Malik: Those are valid concerns. It’s good to see you’re considering both the technical side and the cultural environment. Have you done any informational interviews or networked within those industries yet?

[09:25] Omar: I’ve started reaching out to some contacts I met at conferences, but I haven’t had many responses yet. I think I need to refine my pitch or maybe understand what I can bring to those roles better.

[09:27] Malik: That’s a smart move. Developing a clear narrative about your transferable skills will help. Remember, your experience in research, data analysis, and teaching are highly valued in industry. Have you thought about creating a story that frames your PhD journey as a hero’s journey?

[09:30] Omar (smiling slightly): I like that idea. Framing my experience as a journey—overcoming challenges, gaining skills—that could make my story more compelling.

[09:32] Malik: Exactly. It allows you to see your story as one of growth and resilience. Now, thinking about work-life balance, what strategies have you tried or considered to manage burnout?

[09:35] Omar: I’ve tried scheduling breaks and setting boundaries here and there, but I still feel overwhelmed, especially with deadlines. I think I need a more sustainable routine.

[09:37] Malik: That’s understandable. Maybe we can explore some reflection exercises to identify what truly energizes you outside of work. Sometimes, reconnecting with personal interests helps restore balance.

[09:40] Omar: Yeah, I used to enjoy reading fiction and going for walks, but I’ve fallen out of those habits. I guess I neglect self-care when I get too focused on research.

[09:42] Malik: That awareness is a strong first step. Incorporating small, intentional activities can make a big difference. Would you be open to setting a goal of dedicating 15 minutes daily to a personal activity you enjoy?

[09:45] Omar: That sounds doable. I think I could start with a walk or reading a chapter in a novel.

[09:47] Malik: Great. Let’s also look at your long-term vision. Where do you see yourself in five years, both professionally and personally?

[09:50] Omar: Honestly, I’m still figuring that out. I want a career where I can make an impact with AI, maybe in ethical AI or education tech. Personally, I’d like to have more time for family and hobbies.

[09:52] Malik: That’s a meaningful vision. To get there, we can work on defining specific steps—like skills to develop, networks to build, and perhaps some informational interviews. How does that sound?

[09:55] Omar: That sounds helpful. I think having a clear plan will make it less overwhelming.

[09:57] Malik: Absolutely. So, for next steps, I suggest you refine your personal narrative, perhaps using the hero journey framework, and identify at least three industry contacts to reach out to for informational interviews. Also, try to establish a small self-care routine.

[10:00] Omar: I can do that. Thanks, Malik. This session helped me see my skills and story more clearly. I feel a bit more confident moving forward.

[10:02] Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Omar. Remember, your journey is unique, and every step you take adds to your story. Let’s check in on your progress next week. Any final questions or thoughts?

[10:05] Omar: No, I think I’m good for now. Thanks again. Looking forward to our next session.

[10:07] Malik: Me too. Have a great week, Omar, and take care of yourself.
