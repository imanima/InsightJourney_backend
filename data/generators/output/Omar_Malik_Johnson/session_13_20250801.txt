09:00 [Start of Session]

Malik Johnson: Good morning, Omar! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or reflections this week?

Omar: Morning, Malik. Thanks. Honestly, I've been feeling a bit more overwhelmed than usual, but also somewhat clearer about what I want to explore. I’ve been thinking a lot about my career options and trying to map out different paths.

Malik: That’s a meaningful step, Omar. It sounds like you're in a space of active reflection, which is great. Do you want to share what specifically has been on your mind?

Omar: Well, I’ve been revisiting my strengths and skills, especially those I developed during my research and teaching assistant roles. But I’m struggling to see how they transfer to industries outside academia. It’s frustrating not knowing where I could fit in after my PhD.

Malik: That’s a common challenge, especially for someone with a specialized background. Let’s start by acknowledging the valuable skills you've gained—critical thinking, data analysis, communication. Remember, your narrative isn't just about academia; it’s about your unique story and strengths. Have you tried mapping these skills onto other industries or roles?

Omar: I’ve made a list, but it feels a bit scattered. I’m unsure if I’m seeing the full picture or just what I know from my current experience.

Malik: That’s a good observation. This is where narrative reframing can help. Instead of seeing your skills solely from your academic perspective, let’s explore stories that highlight your transferable strengths across different contexts. Would you like to try a quick exercise now?

Omar: Sure, I’m willing.

[09:10]

Malik: Great. Think of a moment during your research or teaching where you faced a challenge but found a creative solution. Can you recall such a story?

Omar: Umm, last semester, I was leading a seminar on machine learning, and some students struggled to grasp a complex concept. I ended up designing an interactive visualization that simplified the idea, and the students responded really positively.

Malik: That’s a powerful story! It shows your problem-solving, creativity, and ability to communicate complex ideas—skills highly valued in many industries. How do you feel about framing that story as part of your professional narrative?

Omar: I see what you mean. I’ve never thought of it as a transferable skill before, but it makes sense now.

Malik: Excellent. And remember, your story of creating that visualization highlights your adaptability and innovation. These are assets regardless of the industry. How does that feel as a shift in perspective?

Omar: It’s enlightening. It makes me more confident that I have skills that can apply elsewhere.

Malik: That’s wonderful to hear. Now, let’s connect this to your broader goals. You mentioned exploring career options—are there particular industries or roles you’re curious about?

Omar: Yes, I’ve been looking into data science roles in healthcare and tech companies. But I’m unsure how my academic experience aligns with those fields.

Malik: Let’s do a quick hero journey map for your career transition. Starting from your current role, what would be the 'call to adventure'—the reason or motivation to explore new paths?

Omar: I think it’s the burnout I’ve been experiencing and a desire to apply my skills in more impactful, practical ways outside of academia.

Malik: That’s a compelling motivation. And what are some 'mentor' figures or resources you could seek out to guide you?

Omar: Probably industry professionals I can connect with through LinkedIn, or attending networking events related to AI in healthcare.

Malik: Great. And what might be some 'trials' or obstacles along the way?

Omar: Time constraints, fear of losing the academic identity, and uncertainty about what roles I’d be qualified for.

Malik: Recognizing these obstacles is key. We can develop strategies to address them, such as informational interviews to clarify roles and skills needed, and gradually build your confidence in transitioning.

Omar: Yeah, I think breaking it down like that makes it less intimidating.

[09:25]

Malik: Absolutely. Now, reflecting on your strengths and your story, what would be a clear next step for you in exploring these new career avenues?

Omar: I think I should reach out to a few industry contacts I’ve connected with briefly during conferences, maybe schedule some informational interviews.

Malik: Excellent plan. How about we set a goal for the week? Perhaps identify three potential contacts and draft personalized outreach messages?

Omar: That sounds doable. I’ll also review my research and teaching experiences to prepare stories I can share during those conversations.

Malik: Perfect. And remember, framing your experiences through storytelling will make your interactions more authentic and memorable. How are you feeling about taking these steps?

Omar: More confident, actually. It feels manageable when broken down.

Malik: That’s great progress. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to focus on next time?

Omar: Maybe I’d like to work on refining my resume and LinkedIn profile to better highlight my transferable skills.

Malik: Sounds like a strong next step. We can review your drafts and work on storytelling techniques for your profiles. To summarize today: you’re recognizing your transferable skills through stories, mapping your career journey, and planning concrete outreach steps. Does that capture it?

Omar: Yes, exactly.

Malik: Fantastic. For next week, your action items are: reach out to at least three contacts for informational interviews, and prepare stories highlighting your skills for these conversations. Also, think about any updates you want to include on your resume and LinkedIn profile.

Omar: Will do. Thanks, Malik. This session really helped me see things more clearly.

Malik: I’m glad to hear that, Omar. Remember, your story is your strength. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week.
