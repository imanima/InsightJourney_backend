Session 9/24
Date: July 04, 2025
Time: 09:00 AM
Client: Omar (PhD Candidate)
Professional: Malik Johnson (Narrative & Career Transition Coach)

[09:00] Malik: Good morning, Omar! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any particular thoughts or feelings you'd like to share today? (smiles warmly)

[09:05] Omar: Morning, Malik. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also curious. I’ve been reflecting on some of the exercises we did last time, especially the hero journey mapping. It’s helped me see my academic journey in a new light, but I still feel uncertain about what comes next.

[09:10] Malik: That’s a significant insight, Omar. It’s completely normal to feel uncertain at this stage, especially when exploring new career directions. You mentioned the hero journey mapping helped you see your story differently—could you tell me more about what stood out to you?

[09:15] Omar: Sure. I realized that my PhD has been like a series of trials—facing setbacks, long nights, self-doubt—but I also see moments where I pushed through, like when I published my first paper. It’s made me think about how I can reframe my story from one of struggle to one of resilience and growth.

[09:20] Malik: That’s a powerful reframing, Omar. Recognizing resilience as a key theme can open up new possibilities. How do you feel about the idea that your experiences, even the setbacks, are actually strengths that can serve you in other paths?

[09:25] Omar: I like that perspective. I’ve always been a perfectionist, so I tend to dwell on failures. But seeing them as part of a bigger story of perseverance makes me feel more confident. I guess I’m starting to see my skills differently too.

[09:30] Malik: Excellent. Let’s build on that. You mentioned transferable skills earlier—what are some strengths you’ve identified that could apply beyond academia?

[09:35] Omar: Well, I think my analytical skills, problem-solving, and data management are strong. Also, my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly—whether through research papers or presentations. I’ve also developed project management skills by coordinating research projects.

[09:40] Malik: Those are valuable assets in many industries. Have you thought about which fields or roles might benefit from these skills?

[09:45] Omar: Not entirely. I’ve been mostly focused on academic research so far. But I’ve been curious about roles in tech companies, maybe in AI product development or data analysis. I’m also interested in the idea of consulting, since it involves problem-solving and communication.

[09:50] Malik: Those sound like promising options. Have you done any informational interviews or industry research to explore these fields further?

[09:55] Omar: I’ve started looking into online resources and some LinkedIn profiles, but I haven’t reached out yet. I feel a bit unsure about how to approach professionals without seeming intrusive.

[10:00] Malik: That’s a common concern, Omar. Building your network can feel intimidating at first. Would you be open to us developing a step-by-step plan together for reaching out to industry contacts? Maybe starting with some targeted questions and a short introduction about your background?

[10:05] Omar: Yes, I think that would help. I want to make those connections feel natural and genuine, not forced.

[10:10] Malik: Absolutely. Authenticity is key. Let’s also consider how you can leverage your strengths in these conversations—perhaps framing your story around your analytical mindset and your passion for AI applications. Remember, your unique perspective as a PhD candidate can be a compelling story.

[10:15] Omar: That’s true. I’ve been so focused on my academic identity that I haven’t thought much about how to tell my story outside of it. Maybe I can craft a narrative that highlights my problem-solving skills and curiosity.

[10:20] Malik: Exactly. Crafting a narrative that emphasizes your strengths aligns with our earlier work on strengths storytelling. Have you thought about creating a personal elevator pitch?

[10:25] Omar: Not yet, but I see how that could be useful. I want it to sound genuine and reflect who I am, not just academic credentials.

[10:30] Malik: Great. We can work on that together. Also, considering your work-life balance concerns, what strategies have you tried to manage burnout so far?

[10:35] Omar: I’ve tried setting boundaries, like designated work hours, and taking breaks to exercise or meditate. But sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed, especially when deadlines are tight.

[10:40] Malik: It’s understandable. Burnout is a common challenge, especially in demanding fields. Have you considered integrating more restorative activities into your routine or perhaps scheduling regular reflection time?

[10:45] Omar: Not systematically, no. I tend to focus on work, but I see the value in dedicated downtime. Maybe I can set aside specific days or times for reflection or leisure.

[10:50] Malik: That sounds like a healthy approach. Remember, balancing your well-being is crucial for sustained success and clarity in your career transition. As we progress, we’ll also explore how your values align with potential career paths, ensuring you find roles that resonate with your authentic self.

[10:55] Omar: I appreciate that. I want to find a path that feels meaningful, not just a job that pays the bills.

[11:00] Malik: That’s a wonderful goal, Omar. To summarize today, we’ve identified your strengths, started framing your story differently, and outlined initial steps for industry research and networking. Your next steps will be to draft your elevator pitch, reach out to at least two industry contacts, and schedule some restorative activities into your week.

[11:05] Omar: That sounds doable. I feel more motivated now, thanks to our discussion.

[11:10] Malik: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is a journey, and you’re making meaningful strides. For next time, let’s review your draft pitch and reflect on any networking experiences you’ve had. Does that work for you?

[11:15] Omar: Yes, absolutely. Looking forward to it.

[11:20] Malik: Excellent. Keep up the good work, Omar. See you next week!

[11:25] Omar: Thanks, Malik. Have a great day!
