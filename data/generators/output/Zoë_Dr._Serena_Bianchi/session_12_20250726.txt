[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(leans forward slightly, attentive)  

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks — I’ve been managing, I think. The fertility treatments are still quite stressful, but I’ve been trying to stay connected with my support network. Work has been busy, but I’m feeling a bit more balanced lately.  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That’s good to hear. It sounds like you’re making some progress in managing your stress. Last time, we talked about using emotion tracking to better understand your feelings during your fertility journey. Have you been practicing that?  

[11:07] Zoë: Yes, I’ve been keeping a journal of my moods and reactions. I notice that I tend to feel more anxious in the mornings, especially when I wake up and think about the upcoming appointments or treatments. Sometimes I feel guilty for feeling overwhelmed when I know I should be staying positive.  

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very insightful observation. Recognizing those morning feelings without judgment is a big step. How do you usually respond to that anxiety?  

[11:12] Zoë: I tend to try to distract myself — scroll through social media or check my fertility app obsessively. But I’ve noticed it just makes me more anxious. I’m trying to breathe and acknowledge the feeling instead.  

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s excellent. Practicing acknowledgment can reduce the intensity of those feelings over time. How is your communication with your partner? Have you been able to share these feelings with him?  

[11:17] Zoë: I think so. We’ve been having more honest talks about how the treatments affect us both emotionally. He’s been really supportive, but I sometimes feel guilty for burdening him with my stress.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: Guilt can be quite common in these situations, especially when sharing vulnerable feelings. Remember, emotional openness can strengthen your connection, and your partner likely appreciates your honesty. Has sharing helped you feel more connected?  

[11:22] Zoë: Yes, definitely. It’s made me realize I don’t have to carry everything alone, which is a relief. But I still find it hard to balance work and self-care during this time.  

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: Balancing work and self-care is a common challenge. You mentioned last time that you use meditation apps; have you been able to incorporate those into your routine consistently?  

[11:27] Zoë: I’ve been trying. I do a 10-minute meditation most mornings, but sometimes I skip it when I’m feeling especially overwhelmed. I also started using a digital journal for my stress levels, which helps me reflect.  

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great practice. Consistency can be tough, but even small daily rituals can build resilience. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels or mood since starting these practices?  

[11:32] Zoë: I think I’m a bit more aware of my emotional patterns now. For example, when I recognize I’m feeling anxious, I can pause and do a quick breathing exercise, which helps me settle. It’s not perfect, but it’s better than before.  

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a significant shift—being able to pause and regulate your emotions. It’s a skill that will serve you well beyond this stress. How do you feel about your relationship’s overall progress over these past months?  

[11:37] Zoë: I feel closer to my partner. We’ve been more intentional with our conversations and support. Still, I worry about how the future will look, especially if treatments don’t work. Sometimes I feel a sense of hope mixed with fear.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That mixture of hope and fear is very natural. It’s important to acknowledge both feelings without judgment. How do you currently cope with that fear?  

[11:42] Zoë: I try to focus on what I can control—like supporting my body and mind—and remind myself that I’m doing everything I can. I also lean on my partner and friends when I need to.  

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a healthy approach. Building a support network and focusing on what’s within your control can help foster resilience. For next steps, I’d like us to explore some specific self-care routines and communication exercises that can further strengthen your relationship. Would that work for you?  

[11:47] Zoë: Yes, I’d like that. I think I need practical tools to handle everything better.  

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Great. For our next session, I’ll prepare some tailored exercises. Before we finish today, is there anything else you want to reflect on or share?  

[11:52] Zoë: Just that I’m grateful for these sessions. They help me stay grounded, even when things feel uncertain.  

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. That sense of gratitude and awareness is powerful. Keep practicing your emotion tracking and self-care routines, and remember, it’s a process. We’ll continue to build on this progress.  

[11:58] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I appreciate your support.  

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome. See you next week, Zoë. Take care until then.
