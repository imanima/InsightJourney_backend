Client: Zoë (UX Researcher)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Zoë offers a small smile, takes a deep breath)  
Zoë: Hi, Serena. It’s been a bit of a mixed bag, honestly. Some days I feel more in control, and others I feel overwhelmed, especially with everything around the fertility treatments.  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. It’s a lot to manage emotionally, physically, and relationally. Do you want to share what’s been most prominent for you lately?  
(Zoë nods slowly)  
Zoë: Well, I’ve been tracking my fertility apps religiously, and I notice I get really anxious when I see numbers not aligning or when I miss a dose. It’s like I’m constantly on edge, even when I’m at work.  

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like the stress from the fertility process is spilling over into other areas of your life, including work. How has that been affecting your relationship?  
Zoë: Honestly, I think it’s been a bit strained. My partner, Jamie, has been patient, but I catch myself shutting down or snapping when I’m stressed. I worry I’m pushing him away, but I also feel like I can’t control these feelings.  

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very common experience in situations like this—feeling overwhelmed and then withdrawing. You mentioned feeling anxious about the numbers; have you noticed specific triggers that escalate this anxiety?  
Zoë: Yes, mostly when I see a negative result or when I’m late taking my medication. It’s like I’m catastrophizing the worst-case scenario every time.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s insightful. Using emotion tracking, have you been able to identify what emotion predominates—fear, disappointment, frustration?  
Zoë: Mostly fear, I think. Fear that it won’t work, or that I won’t be able to handle the disappointment if it doesn’t.  

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s very powerful awareness. Fear often signals our attachment to outcomes, especially when they’re tied to our hopes or identity. How does that fear show up in your body?  
Zoë: I notice my chest gets tight, and sometimes I get a headache. I also feel restless, like I can’t sit still.  

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: Noticing these physical sensations is a great step. It allows us to intervene early. Have you tried any self-care techniques or grounding exercises when you feel this way?  
Zoë: I’ve been meditating a bit, but I haven’t been consistent. Sometimes I just scroll through social media or work extra hours to distract myself.  

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: Distraction can be helpful temporarily, but it’s also good to have some grounding tools that help you stay connected to your feelings. Would you like to explore some brief grounding exercises today?  
Zoë: Yes, I think that would be helpful.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s try a simple breathing exercise. Breathe in slowly for four seconds, hold for four, and exhale for four. As you breathe, focus on the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. Would you like to do that now?  
(Zoë nods, follows the instructions, visibly relaxing slightly)  

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: How do you feel now?  
Zoë: Slightly calmer. It’s like I remembered I have some control over my body, even if I can’t control the situation entirely.  

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a valuable insight—focusing on what’s within your control. Over the past sessions, we’ve worked on communication exercises with Jamie. How has that been going?  
Zoë: It’s been a bit better. I’ve tried to be more open about how anxious I’m feeling, especially when I notice myself shutting down. Jamie has been really supportive, but I worry I’m not always clear enough.  

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: Clear communication is a process. Remember, sharing your feelings and needs is a skill that improves with practice. Would it help to role-play a recent conversation where you felt stuck?  
Zoë: Yes, actually. I’d like to try that.  

[12:00] (They role-play a scenario where Zoë expresses her stress about fertility and her need for support, practicing “I” statements and active listening.)  

[12:05] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. How did that feel?  
Zoë: It felt a bit awkward at first, but I think I got my point across better than I usually do. It’s reassuring to practice these in a safe space.  

[12:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s the goal—building confidence in your communication. Now, considering your work-life balance, how have you been managing your energy during this intensive period?  
Zoë: Honestly, I’ve been pushing myself a lot. I try to set boundaries, but I often find myself working late or skipping breaks, especially when the stress spikes.  

[12:15] Dr. Bianchi: Recognizing that is important. Setting small boundaries—like scheduled breaks—can help you preserve your energy. Have you considered integrating brief self-care moments into your day?  
Zoë: I’ve thought about it, but I haven’t prioritized it. I think I need to start small, maybe just five minutes for stretching or breathing.  

[12:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start. Remember, consistency is key. Also, involving Jamie in your self-care plan might strengthen your support network. Have you talked with him about how he can support you during these times?  
Zoë: Yes, I’ve shared some of my feelings, and he’s been understanding. We’ve even planned to do some relaxing activities together, like going for walks or watching movies.  

[12:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful. Building shared moments can really reinforce your connection. Looking ahead, what would you like to focus on in our next session?  
Zoë: I’d like to work more on managing my stress and maintaining open communication with Jamie. Also, finding some consistent self-care routines that I can stick to.  

[12:30] Dr. Bianchi: Those are great goals. I’ll prepare some exercises and resources to support your stress management and communication skills. Before we finish, do you feel ready to try a quick visualization exercise for emotional resilience?  
Zoë: Yes, I’d like that.  

[12:35] (They do a brief visualization where Zoë imagines herself handling stressful situations with calm and confidence.)  

[12:40] Dr. Bianchi: How do you feel after that exercise?  
Zoë: More hopeful, surprisingly. It’s nice to see myself coping well, even in imagined scenarios.  

[12:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a powerful tool to reinforce your resilience. Remember, you’ve made significant progress over these past months, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Your effort is truly commendable.  

[12:50] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I really appreciate this space and the tools you’ve given me. I feel more equipped to handle what's ahead.  

[12:55] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. As always, I’ll send you some summaries of today’s exercises and some resources on stress management and communication. Our next session will be in a week.  

[13:00] Zoë: Sounds good. Thanks again, Serena.  

(They smile warmly as the session concludes.)
