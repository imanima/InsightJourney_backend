**[11:00]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**Zoë:** Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a mixed bag. Some days I feel more in control, but other days, the stress around fertility and balancing everything just hits hard.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds exhausting. I remember last time we discussed your workload and how your fertility journey has been a significant stressor. Have there been any particular moments this week where those feelings became more intense?  

**Zoë:** Yeah, actually. On Tuesday, I had a tough meeting at work, and right after, I started feeling overwhelmed about everything—my project deadlines, the fertility apps reminding me of my cycle, and just this general sense of uncertainty.  

**[11:10]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with so many competing demands. You mentioned the fertility apps—how have you been engaging with those lately?  

**Zoë:** I’ve been tracking consistently, but sometimes I find myself obsessing over the data—like, analyzing every little change. It’s helpful but also anxiety-provoking. I notice I get caught in a loop of checking and analyzing.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a common response—trying to gain control over something uncertain. When you notice yourself doing that, what do you usually do?  

**Zoë:** I try to take a break, do some deep breathing, or journal. But honestly, it’s hard to break the cycle when I’m feeling stressed.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a good start—recognizing the pattern and employing grounding techniques. Let’s remember those tools we practiced earlier. Have you tried any new self-care strategies this week?  

**Zoë:** I’ve been doing 10 minutes of meditation in the morning, which helps sometimes. I also started reconnecting with my partner more intentionally—just small things like sharing a cup of tea and checking in.  

**[11:20]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s wonderful, Zoë. Those small moments can make a big difference. How is your partner responding to your efforts?  

**Zoë:** He’s been supportive, but I think he’s also worried about me. Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one carrying this burden, even though I know he’s there.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** It’s important to acknowledge that both of you are affected. Sometimes, sharing our vulnerabilities can help deepen connection. Have you found any particular ways to communicate your feelings effectively?  

**Zoë:** I’ve been trying to use “I” statements—like, “I feel anxious when I see the apps,” instead of blaming or sounding accusatory. It helps him understand where I’m coming from.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s excellent. It fosters safety and openness. Over the past few sessions, we’ve worked on emotional tracking and sharing feelings—how do you feel those techniques are working for you?  

**Zoë:** I think they’re helping me become more aware of what I’m feeling and why. Sometimes, just naming the emotion—like frustration or sadness—takes away some of its power.  

**[11:30]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a key insight—emotion naming as a form of validation and distancing. Now, considering your work-life balance, how have things been on that front?  

**Zoë:** It’s still a challenge. Work demands are high, and I often bring stress home, which affects my mood and my relationship. I’m trying to set boundaries, like not checking emails after 6 pm, but sometimes I slip.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** Boundaries are crucial. How do you feel about your current boundary-setting? Are there specific obstacles?  

**Zoë:** Honestly, I find it hard to disconnect completely, especially when I think about the fertility treatments and the deadlines at work. It feels like I’m always on.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That constant state of alertness can be exhausting. Maybe we can explore some techniques to help you truly disconnect, like a dedicated wind-down ritual or mindfulness practice at the end of the day.  

**Zoë:** I’d like that. I think I need to find a way to switch off mentally.  

**[11:40]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Absolutely. Also, building a support network—whether friends, family, or support groups—can provide additional relief. Have you reached out to anyone outside of your partner?  

**Zoë:** Not really. I’ve been relying mostly on my partner and journaling. I worry about burdening my friends or family with my worries.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** It’s common to feel that way, but sharing your feelings can lighten your emotional load. Support groups for fertility challenges or stress management might also be helpful. Would you consider exploring some options?  

**Zoë:** Maybe. I’m open to it, but I’m not sure where to start.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** I can help you look into local or online groups. Also, we can work on some communication skills to help you express your needs to your support network.  

**[11:50]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Looking back over the past six months, I see how much progress you’ve made—your awareness of emotions, improving communication with your partner, and trying new self-care routines. How do you feel about your overall journey?  

**Zoë:** Honestly, I’m proud of how far I’ve come. It’s been tough, but I feel more in control than I did at the beginning. I still have moments of doubt and stress, but I’m learning to handle them better.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a significant achievement. Progress isn’t always linear, and acknowledging your resilience is important. Moving forward, let’s focus on strengthening your self-care routines and expanding your support system.  

**Zoë:** Sounds good. I want to keep working on managing stress better and staying connected with my partner.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** Excellent. For next week, I’d like you to try a daily gratitude journal and practice a brief mindfulness exercise before bed. Also, let’s explore some local or online support groups together.  

**Zoë:** I’ll do that. Thank you, Serena. I feel more hopeful today.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s wonderful to hear, Zoë. Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing an amazing job. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll continue building on this foundation.  

**Zoë:** Thanks again. See you next week.
