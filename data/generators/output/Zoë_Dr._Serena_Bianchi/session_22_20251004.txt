[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Zoë: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster—stressful week at work, and I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed with everything going on with the fertility treatments.  
Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with so much on your plate. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been the most challenging for you lately?  

[11:05] Zoë: I think the biggest thing is balancing everything—work deadlines, my health appointments, and trying to stay connected with my partner. Sometimes I feel like I’m just running in place, not really making progress.  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a lot to juggle. It’s good you’re aware of how these different parts are impacting you. Have there been moments where you felt more centered or in control?  

[11:10] Zoë: Actually, yes. I’ve been practicing some of the meditation techniques we worked on last month, and on some mornings, I feel a bit more grounded. But then, by the afternoon, the stress creeps back in.  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common experience—finding moments of calm amidst ongoing stress. It’s encouraging that meditation is helping, even if temporarily. How do you notice that stress affecting your relationship with your partner?  

[11:15] Zoë: We’ve had some tension, especially when I’m irritable or distracted. I think I sometimes shut down or get defensive, which makes it harder for us to connect. I hate feeling like I’m pushing him away when I need support most.  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very honest reflection. Often, when we’re overwhelmed, it’s natural to withdraw or become defensive. Have you noticed specific triggers that lead to these reactions?  

[11:20] Zoë: Usually, it’s when I get a bad update from my doctor or when a work project suddenly becomes urgent. My patience just drains away, and I realize I’m not really listening anymore.  
Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like these stressors are triggering emotional overwhelm, which then impacts your ability to be present with your partner. Would you be open to exploring some emotion-tracking exercises to help identify these moments more clearly?  

[11:25] Zoë: Yes, I think that could help. Sometimes I don’t even realize how intense my feelings are until I blow up or shut down.  
Dr. Bianchi: Exactly. Tracking your emotions can give us insight into patterns and help you develop strategies to manage them before they escalate. Let’s also consider how you can communicate these feelings to your partner in ways that foster connection rather than distance.  

[11:30] Zoë: That makes sense. I want to do better at sharing what I’m feeling rather than just shutting down. It’s hard though—I’m worried about how he’ll react or if I’ll burden him too much.  
Dr. Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel that way. Remember, sharing your feelings is a form of vulnerability that can deepen your connection. We can work on some specific communication tools to help you express yourself more effectively and safely.  

[11:35] Zoë: I’d like that. I also wonder if I’m being too hard on myself—trying to balance everything perfectly, when I know I should just accept that some days are harder than others.  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very compassionate insight. Self-compassion is crucial, especially during stressful times. We can explore some self-compassion exercises next, to help you nurture a kinder inner dialogue.  

[11:40] Zoë: I’d like that. Sometimes I beat myself up for not being “productive” enough or for feeling overwhelmed. I know it’s not realistic to always be on top of everything.  
Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely. Recognizing your limits and being gentle with yourself can reduce some of that internal pressure. Let’s also review some recent journaling or app notes you’ve made—perhaps there are themes or insights we can highlight.  

[11:45] Zoë: Sure, I’ve been documenting my mood swings and some of the thoughts I have when I feel anxious. I notice that when I see negative comments at work or reminders about fertility setbacks, my mood shifts pretty quickly.  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s valuable awareness. It shows how external stressors influence your emotional state. We can work on building a resilience toolkit—things you can do in those moments to stabilize your mood and prevent escalation.  

[11:50] Zoë: That sounds helpful. I want to feel more in control, not just reacting to everything around me. I also worry about how this stress affects my relationship long-term. I don’t want to lose that connection.  
Dr. Bianchi: Maintaining your relationship is a key goal. The fact that you’re reflecting on it shows your commitment. We’ll look at ways to strengthen your emotional bond, even during challenging times. Perhaps some shared activities or regular check-ins could help.  

[11:55] Zoë: I like that idea. We’ve been a bit distant lately, and I think scheduling some quality time could make a difference. I’ll talk to him about it.  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great step. As homework, I’d like you to continue tracking your emotions, especially during stressful moments, and to practice one of the communication strategies we discussed—like using “I” statements or sharing your feelings openly.  

[12:00] Zoë: Okay, I can do that. I feel a bit more hopeful after talking through all this.  
Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that, Zoë. Remember, progress is often non-linear, and each small step counts. Next time, we can review your emotion logs and see how these new strategies are working for you. Would you like to set a specific goal for the coming week?  

[12:05] Zoë: Yes, I think I’ll focus on being more mindful during stressful moments and trying to communicate my feelings to my partner more openly.  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a wonderful goal. Keep practicing self-compassion along the way. I look forward to hearing how it goes next week. Thanks for sharing so openly today.  

[12:10] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. It really helps to have a space to process all this.  
Dr. Bianchi: My pleasure, Zoë. Take care, and see you next week.
