**[11:00]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Good morning, Zoë. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**Zoë:** Hi, Serena. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. The fertility treatments are ongoing, and work has been pretty intense. I feel a bit overwhelmed but also trying to stay focused.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds like a lot to juggle. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with everything going on. Would you like to start by sharing how you've been managing your stress lately?  

**Zoë:** Sure. I’ve been using my meditation app almost daily, which helps a little. I also keep a digital journal, especially when I have intense feelings. But honestly, some days I still feel like I’m just holding everything together.  

**[11:10]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** It’s good that you’re actively using those tools. It’s a sign of resilience. When you say you feel like you’re just holding it together, can you tell me more about what that feels like emotionally?  

**Zoë:** It’s a mixed bag. Sometimes I feel hopeful, especially when I get good news from the clinic. But then, moments later, I feel anxious or sad, especially when I think about how uncertain everything is, or how this is affecting my relationship.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That fluctuation makes sense, especially given the ongoing uncertainty with fertility. It’s like riding an emotional rollercoaster. Have you noticed specific triggers that bring on the anxiety or sadness?  

**Zoë:** Yes. For example, if I see a friend posting about their pregnancy or baby announcement, I get a wave of jealousy and sadness. Also, long days at work when I don’t get a chance to process my feelings tend to build up.  

**[11:20]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Those are very human reactions, Zoë. It’s important to recognize those triggers without judgment. How has your communication been with your partner about these feelings?  

**Zoë:** We’ve been talking more openly, especially about how stressed I feel. But sometimes I notice I hold back, not wanting to burden him or make him worry. I think he’s also feeling the strain but doesn’t always say it.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s understandable. Sometimes, we hesitate to share our deepest feelings, fearing it might add to our partner’s stress. Have you noticed any patterns in how you both communicate when stress peaks?  

**Zoë:** Yeah, when I get overwhelmed, I tend to withdraw or become more irritable. He tends to become quieter or more distant. We’ve had a few misunderstandings because of that.  

**[11:30]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** It’s common in times of stress for communication to shift in ways that aren’t always helpful. Last time, we worked on some communication exercises. Have you been able to practice any of those with him?  

**Zoë:** I tried. We did a couple of the “active listening” exercises. It helped us understand each other better, but I still find it hard to stay open when I’m feeling vulnerable.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a normal challenge. Building emotional openness takes time. Let’s explore some ways you can gently strengthen that muscle. For example, when you notice yourself withdrawing, can you pause and acknowledge that feeling internally before responding?  

**Zoë:** I think I can try that. It’s just hard to slow down sometimes. I catch myself rushing or shutting down.  

**[11:40]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** That awareness is a great first step. And with practice, it can become more natural. Let’s shift gears a little. You mentioned work has been intense. How are you managing your work-life balance right now?  

**Zoë:** Honestly, it’s been tough. I’ve been working late a lot, especially when I get anxious about my fertility. It’s like my mind is racing, and I just want to distract myself. But that means I often skip meals or forget to take breaks.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s quite common when we’re under stress. Do you have any routines or rituals that help you disconnect from work at the end of the day?  

**Zoë:** Not really. I usually just crash on the couch and scroll through social media or watch shows. Sometimes I forget to set boundaries, especially when I have a deadline looming.  

**[11:50]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Establishing some boundaries could help create space for self-care. For example, setting a specific time to disconnect from work, or having a small ritual like a walk or stretching. Would you be open to trying a new routine this week?  

**Zoë:** Yeah, I think I could try that. Maybe I’ll set an alarm to remind me to step away from my laptop.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds like a good start. Also, integrating brief moments of mindfulness during the day—like a few deep breaths—might help ease the tension.  

**Zoë:** I like that idea. It’s simple but might make a difference.  

**[12:00]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Excellent. Now, looking at the bigger picture, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made over these 13 sessions?  

**Zoë:** I think I’ve learned a lot about my emotional patterns and how to communicate better with my partner. I still have a long way to go, especially with managing stress, but I feel more hopeful and equipped.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s wonderful to hear. Change is a process, and you’re actively engaging in it. Remember, resilience builds over time, especially with consistent effort.  

**Zoë:** Thanks. I do feel more grounded, even if things are still tough.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a strong place to be. Before we wrap up today, do you want to set any specific goals for the coming week?  

**Zoë:** I’d like to practice the boundary-setting routine and try the mindfulness exercises daily. Also, I’ll check in with my partner about sharing feelings more openly.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** Great goals. I’ll look forward to hearing about how those go next time. Any final thoughts or questions before we finish?  

**Zoë:** No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Serena.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** You’re very welcome, Zoë. Remember, you’re making important strides. Take care until our next session.  

**Zoë:** Thanks. See you next week.
