[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or feelings you'd like to start with today?

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. I’ve been… okay, I guess. The fertility process is still pretty stressful, but I’ve been trying to keep up with my meditation and journaling. It helps sometimes, but I still feel overwhelmed a lot of the time.

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like you’re actively using some helpful strategies, which is great. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially with everything you’re managing. Have there been moments where those techniques felt particularly effective or, conversely, insufficient?

[11:07] Zoë: Meditation helps me pause and breathe, especially during work when deadlines are tight. But when I get bad news from the clinic or my hormone levels fluctuate unexpectedly, I feel like I’m back at square one—really anxious, worried about how this will turn out, and sometimes, I just want to give up.

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very natural response—feeling a mix of hope and fear, especially in such an uncertain journey. It sounds like your emotional rollercoaster is quite intense. Can you tell me more about how these fluctuations impact your relationship with your partner?

[11:12] Zoë: Yeah, I think it’s been tough. I notice I sometimes withdraw or become irritable. Last week, I snapped at Alex after a long day. He tried to comfort me, but I pushed him away, feeling like I didn't want to burden him with my worries.

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very honest reflection. It’s common to want to protect loved ones from our pain, but it can also create distance. How do you think Alex perceives your reactions?

[11:17] Zoë: I think he feels helpless and maybe a bit frustrated. He keeps saying he’s here for me, but I don’t want him to carry my stress. Sometimes I feel guilty for leaning on him too much, but then I also feel like I need that support.

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: It’s a delicate balance—wanting to share your feelings while also preserving his well-being. Have you and Alex talked about how you can support each other during this time, especially when emotions run high?

[11:22] Zoë: We’ve tried, but I think we’re still figuring it out. Last month, we did a communication exercise from our last session, where we took turns sharing feelings without interruption. It helped, but it’s hard to keep that going when things are stressful.

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start, Zoë. Recognizing where communication can improve is part of the process. How do you feel about introducing some specific self-care routines together, to foster connection and reduce misunderstandings?

[11:27] Zoë: I like that idea. Maybe doing something relaxing together—like a walk or meditation? I think it could help us reconnect beyond just talking about fertility.

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely. Shared activities can strengthen your bond and provide mutual comfort. Have you considered any particular activities that resonate with both of you?

[11:32] Zoë: We both enjoy nature, so maybe evening walks. Also, Alex mentioned he’d be open to attending some counseling sessions with me, which I think could help us both process things.

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful—collaborative support is so beneficial. Attending sessions together can enhance understanding and empathy. How do you feel about discussing your emotional state more openly with Alex, perhaps using some of the emotion tracking techniques we’ve worked on?

[11:37] Zoë: I think I could try. Sometimes I hide how much I’m struggling because I don’t want to worry him or seem needy. But I realize sharing might actually bring us closer.

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s an insightful realization. Remember, vulnerability fosters intimacy. Next, let’s explore some ways you can express your feelings honestly, while also honoring your need for support. How does that sound?

[11:42] Zoë: That sounds good. I want to feel more connected and less isolated in this process.

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. As we move forward, I’d like you to keep a journal of your emotional experiences—when you feel most overwhelmed, and times when sharing or engaging in self-care helps. We can review this in our next session and develop tailored strategies. Does that work for you?

[11:47] Zoë: Yes, I can do that. It might help me see patterns I haven't noticed.

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Great. To summarize, today we acknowledged the ongoing stress from fertility challenges, the impact on your relationship, and explored ways to improve communication and shared self-care. Next time, we’ll review your journal, deepen some emotion-focused techniques, and look at building your support network.

[11:52] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I feel a bit more hopeful after this talk.

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful to hear. Hope is a vital part of resilience. Remember, I’m here to support you through this. See you next week.
