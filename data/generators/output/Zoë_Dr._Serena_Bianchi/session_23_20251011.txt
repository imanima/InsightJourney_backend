Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Zoë (UX Researcher)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling pretty overwhelmed with everything—work, the fertility process, and trying to keep things steady with Mark.

[11:04] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a lot to juggle. Do you want to tell me more about what’s been most challenging this week?

[11:06] Zoë: Yeah. Well, I’ve been feeling anxious about the fertility treatments—like, I’m constantly checking my apps, and it’s hard not to get caught up in the worry. And at work, I’ve had some tight deadlines, which adds to the stress. Plus, Mark and I had a few tense conversations about how we’re coping.

[11:08] Dr. Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with all these layers. You mentioned tension with Mark—how has that been showing up between you two?

[11:10] Zoë: Sometimes, I notice I’m snapping at him more than usual, even when he’s just trying to be supportive. Last night, we had a small argument about me needing space and him feeling shut out. I hate that we’re drifting apart a little.

[11:12] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a meaningful recognition—that you’re aware of the tension and how it’s affecting both of you. When you think about those moments, what emotions come up for you?

[11:14] Zoë: Mostly frustration and sadness. I want to be close to him, but I also feel like I’m barely holding myself together sometimes. It’s like I’m caught between trying to stay positive and feeling overwhelmed.

[11:16] Dr. Bianchi: That’s very insightful. It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of hope and grief—hope for the future, but also grief over what feels lost right now. Can you tell me about a recent moment where you felt a bit of hope or resilience?

[11:18] Zoë: Actually, yes. Yesterday, I took a few minutes during my lunch break to journal. I wrote about how I’ve managed to stay committed to my self-care routines—like my meditation app and walking. It reminded me that I’m still taking steps to care for myself, even if it’s small.

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful. Recognizing those small acts of self-care can be powerful during stressful times. How did you feel after journaling?

[11:22] Zoë: Relieved, I think. Like I was giving myself a bit of space to breathe. But then the cycle of worry quickly came back when I checked my fertility app again.

[11:24] Dr. Bianchi: It’s normal for those worries to resurface. Part of our work can be finding ways to hold those feelings without them taking over completely. You mentioned Mark feeling shut out—how do you think he’s been managing all of this?

[11:26] Zoë: Honestly, I think he’s trying, but sometimes I see him retreating emotionally. He’s been working late more often, and I catch him scrolling through his phone, probably avoiding conversations. I worry he’s feeling helpless too.

[11:28] Dr. Bianchi: That mutual sense of helplessness can deepen the distance. Have you and Mark talked about how each of you is feeling, openly?

[11:30] Zoë: We’ve tried, but it’s hard. When I bring up my feelings, he gets quiet, and I don’t want to push him away further. But I also need to feel supported.

[11:32] Dr. Bianchi: Communication can be tricky, especially when emotions are high. One technique we can work on is sharing feelings using "I" statements—like "I feel anxious when..."—to help express yourself without blame. Would you like to practice that now?

[11:34] Zoë: Sure. That might help.

[11:36] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Why don’t you start by sharing what you’re feeling right now?

[11:38] Zoë: Okay. (pauses) I feel worried about how the stress is affecting us, and I also feel a bit lonely because I miss feeling close to Mark.

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very honest and vulnerable sharing. How do you think Mark might respond if you expressed that to him?

[11:42] Zoë: Maybe he’d feel guilty, but also maybe relieved that I’m opening up. I think he wants to support me, but he doesn’t always know how.

[11:44] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good insight. Sometimes, just sharing your feelings like that can encourage the other person to do the same. We can also explore ways to create more space for these conversations without feeling like it’s adding pressure.

[11:46] Zoë: Yeah, I’d like that. It’s been hard to find the right moment.

[11:48] Dr. Bianchi: We can work on identifying small, intentional moments for connection. Now, considering your work stress, how are you managing to balance your professional responsibilities with your personal needs?

[11:50] Zoë: Honestly, not very well. I’ve been pushing myself to keep up at work, even if I feel exhausted. Sometimes I skip meals or stay late just to meet deadlines. It’s like I’m running on empty.

[11:52] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common response to stress, but it’s unsustainable. How might you incorporate some small self-care practices into your day, even during busy periods?

[11:54] Zoë: Maybe I can set a reminder to step away for a few minutes, do some breathing exercises, or just stretch. I think that could help me reset.

[11:56] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a good plan. Even brief moments of mindfulness or movement can make a difference. Remember, taking care of yourself isn’t selfish—it’s necessary for your resilience.

[11:58] Zoë: Thanks. I forget that sometimes, especially when I’m so focused on everything else.

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: It’s easy to do. As we wrap up today, I’d like us to set some small goals for the week. How does that sound?

[12:02] Zoë: That sounds good.

[12:04] Dr. Bianchi: First, I’d like you to try sharing one feeling with Mark using an "I" statement this week. Second, incorporate at least two short self-care breaks into your daily routine. And third, continue your journaling—perhaps noting any moments of resilience or hope you experience.

[12:06] Zoë: Okay, I can do that. Thanks, Serena.

[12:08] Dr. Bianchi: You're welcome. Remember, progress isn’t always linear, and it’s okay to have setbacks. We’ll continue working on these together. Do you have any questions or anything else you’d like to share before we finish?

[12:10] Zoë: Not right now. Just grateful for the support. I feel a bit more grounded after talking today.

[12:12] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Take care of yourself this week, Zoë. I look forward to our next session.

[12:14] Zoë: Me too. Thanks again. Bye.
