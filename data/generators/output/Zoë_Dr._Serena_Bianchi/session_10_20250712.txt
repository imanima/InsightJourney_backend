[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?  
(Zoë offers a small smile, looks a bit tired but composed.)  

[11:03] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster—some days feel more manageable, but the stress around everything, especially fertility stuff, still weighs heavily. I’ve been trying to stay grounded with meditation, but it’s hard to fully shake the anxiety.  

[11:07] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Fertility journeys can be incredibly taxing emotionally and physically. How are you and your partner coping with these fluctuations?  

[11:10] Zoë: We’re doing okay, I think. We talk about it sometimes, but I notice I tend to withdraw when I’m overwhelmed. I don’t want to seem distant, but I also feel like I need space to process. Sometimes I worry I’m not being fully present with him.  

[11:13] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common experience—feeling torn between need for connection and needing space to process emotions. Have you noticed any specific triggers that make you withdraw?  

[11:16] Zoë: Yeah, usually when I get bad news from the doctor or when I see a fertility app notification reminding me of my cycle. It’s like a wave of disappointment or frustration hits, and I just want to retreat.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like those notifications amplify your feelings of disappointment. That’s very insightful. Have you been able to use any of the emotion-tracking techniques we discussed previously when those moments happen?  

[11:23] Zoë: I’ve tried to note what I’m feeling right away, but honestly, sometimes I just feel overwhelmed and forget to pause. I do notice that journaling helps when I sit down afterward—getting the feelings out helps me process.  

[11:27] Dr. Bianchi: That’s great progress. Recognizing early signals is key. Let’s explore that journaling a bit—what do you notice about the emotions you write down? Are there recurring themes or feelings?  

[11:30] Zoë: Mostly frustration, sadness, and sometimes guilt—like I should be more positive or grateful. But then I remind myself that those feelings are normal, especially with everything going on.  

[11:33] Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely, those are very common reactions. Your awareness of guilt is important—they often come with fertility stress. How does your partner respond when you share these feelings?  

[11:37] Zoë: He’s supportive, but I think he struggles a bit with knowing what I need. Sometimes I don’t even know myself. I’ve been trying to tell him when I need a hug or just some quiet time, but I think I could be clearer.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: Clarity in communication is a great goal. Let’s practice a couple of statements you might use to express your needs more directly. For example, “I need some time to myself right now,” or “I’d love a hug and some quiet support.” Would you like to try crafting a couple together?  

[11:43] Zoë: Sure. Maybe something like, “I’m feeling overwhelmed right now, and I just need a little space to breathe”?  

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s excellent—clear and honest. Remember, expressing your feelings and needs openly can foster closeness even in difficult moments. Have you noticed any shifts in your relationship since we started focusing on communication?  

[11:50] Zoë: I think so. We’re starting to talk more about what we’re each feeling, especially after I’ve journaled or used the emotion tracker. It’s helping us feel more connected, even if the situation is hard.  

[11:53] Dr. Bianchi: That’s encouraging progress. Building that emotional connection is vital, especially during stressful times. Now, you mentioned work-life balance being challenging. How has that been lately?  

[11:57] Zoë: It’s still tough. I’ve been working late more often because of project deadlines, and I feel guilty taking time for myself or for us. But I also know I need to set boundaries to avoid burnout.  

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: Setting boundaries is essential. Have you tried any specific techniques to protect your personal time, like scheduled breaks or digital detox periods?  

[12:03] Zoë: I’ve started turning off work notifications after 6 PM and trying to meditate for 10 minutes before bed. It’s a small step, but it helps me feel a bit more in control.  

[12:07] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great start. Small, consistent actions can make a big difference. How do you feel about balancing your career ambitions with your current emotional needs?  

[12:10] Zoë: It’s a constant juggling act. I want to keep growing professionally, but I also recognize I need to prioritize my health and relationship more. Sometimes I feel guilty for taking time off, but I realize it’s necessary.  

[12:13] Dr. Bianchi: Guilt can be a tough emotion, especially when trying to balance multiple important areas. Part of our work can involve reframing that guilt as self-care and necessity. How does that resonate with you?  

[12:17] Zoë: That makes sense. I think I often see taking care of myself as selfish, but I know it’s actually essential for my well-being and for being present in my relationship.  

[12:20] Dr. Bianchi: Exactly. Self-compassion is key. As we near the end of our session, I’d like to suggest a few action steps: continue your emotion journaling, practice the clear communication statements with your partner, and set a small boundary at work to protect your personal time. How does that sound?  

[12:23] Zoë: That sounds good. I’ll try to be more mindful about checking in with my feelings and communicating them.  

[12:26] Dr. Bianchi: Wonderful. Next time, we can explore how these new strategies are working and address any new challenges that arise. Remember, progress is a journey—be gentle with yourself.  

[12:28] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I really appreciate the support and the tools. It’s helpful to see some light at the end of the tunnel.  

[12:30] Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome, Zoë. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Have a restful week, and take care.  

(Zoë nods and smiles gently as the session concludes.)
