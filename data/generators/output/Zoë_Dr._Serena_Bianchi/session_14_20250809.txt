[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(leans forward slightly, warm smile)  

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The fertility treatments have been exhausting, and work has been hectic with some major deadlines. I’ve been feeling pretty drained emotionally.  

[11:04] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel drained with everything happening at once. Have there been particular moments this week where those feelings have come up strongly?  

[11:06] Zoë: Yeah, yesterday I had a moment during a team meeting when I felt overwhelmed, and I just wanted to disappear. I realized I’ve been carrying a lot of stress, but I haven’t really sat with it until now.  

[11:08] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a significant insight—recognizing when stress surfaces. When you notice that feeling of wanting to disappear, what do you think is underlying that emotion?  

[11:10] Zoë: I think it’s a mix of exhaustion, frustration that things aren’t moving faster with fertility, and a fear of not being able to balance everything. Sometimes I just feel like I’m failing at both work and my personal goals.  

[11:12] Dr. Bianchi: It’s very brave of you to share that. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of weight—feeling like you’re failing at balancing work and personal hopes. How does that affect your relationship with your partner?  

[11:14] Zoë: We’ve been arguing more lately. Small things, but I think we’re both feeling the pressure. I know I haven’t been fully present with him, and I worry I’m pulling away.  

[11:16] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common response when under stress—pulling away or becoming less present. Have you noticed any specific patterns in your communication with him during these stressful times?  

[11:18] Zoë: I tend to be more withdrawn, and I avoid talking about how I feel because I don’t want to burden him. But then I realize I’m just building walls.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: Recognizing that pattern is a great step. It sounds like you’re trying to protect him, but it’s impacting your connection. Would you be open to exploring some ways to communicate your feelings more openly, even when it’s hard?  

[11:22] Zoë: Yeah, I think that would help. I want to be honest, but I also don’t want to overwhelm him.  

[11:24] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very common concern. We can look at gentle ways to share your feelings—starting with small, honest check-ins. Also, I’d like to revisit some emotion-tracking from previous sessions. How have you been doing with that?  

[11:26] Zoë: I’ve been trying, especially with my digital journal. I’ve noted when I feel overwhelmed or anxious, and I’ve noticed that my stress peaks around certain times of the day, especially in the evenings.  

[11:28] Dr. Bianchi: That’s insightful. Identifying those patterns can really help in managing your stress proactively. Have you experimented with any self-care or stress-reduction strategies during those peak times?  

[11:30] Zoë: I’ve started doing short meditation sessions in the evening, about 10 minutes. It helps a bit, but sometimes I feel guilty taking that time when I think I should be more productive.  

[11:32] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common feeling—balancing self-care and productivity. Remember, self-care isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity, especially during stressful periods. Would you be willing to try framing that meditation as a vital part of your routine, almost like a non-negotiable?  

[11:34] Zoë: Yes, I think I can do that. It might help me see it as a tool to stay resilient, not as wasted time.  

[11:36] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Also, given your work in UX research, I wonder if you’ve noticed any patterns in your digital habits that might be contributing to your stress—like overchecking fertility apps or social media?  

[11:38] Zoë: I do tend to obsessively check my fertility app, especially in the mornings. It’s become a bit compulsive, and I think it heightens my anxiety when there’s no progress or unexpected results.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Sometimes, our digital habits can intensify stress. Would you be open to setting designated times to check those apps, and perhaps replacing some of that time with your meditation or other calming activities?  

[11:42] Zoë: Yeah, I can try that. I think limiting those checks could help me feel less obsessed and more in control.  

[11:44] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great plan. As we move forward, I’d like us to continue exploring your emotional responses, strengthening communication with your partner, and integrating self-care strategies. How does that sound?  

[11:46] Zoë: It sounds good. I really want to feel more balanced and connected, even during these tough times.  

[11:48] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a wonderful goal, Zoë. Remember, progress is about small steps, and you’re already making meaningful connections with your feelings. For next week, I’d like you to try the new app-checking schedule and reflect on your experience. Also, perhaps practice sharing a small feeling with your partner, even if it’s just a brief “I’m feeling overwhelmed today.”  

[11:50] Zoë: I can do that. Thanks, Serena. I already feel a bit lighter just talking about it.  

[11:52] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. It’s a pleasure working with you. Take gentle care of yourself this week, and we’ll continue building on this progress next session.  

[11:54] Zoë: Thanks, see you next week.  

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: See you then. Have a good rest of your day.
