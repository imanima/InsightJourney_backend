Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Zoë (UX Researcher)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and with everything going on with the fertility treatments, I feel a little overwhelmed at times.

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds quite challenging. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when juggling such significant life events and work demands. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been most present for you emotionally this week?

[11:07] Zoë: I think mostly frustration and fatigue. I’ve been tracking my emotions with an app, and I notice I get really anxious when I think about the upcoming fertility appointments. Sometimes I feel guilty for feeling exhausted—like I should just push through.

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: It’s very insightful that you’re tracking your emotions. That awareness can be a powerful tool. You mention feeling anxious and guilty—can you tell me more about those feelings? For instance, what does anxiety feel like in your body? And what do you notice when you feel guilty?

[11:12] Zoë: Sure. The anxiety feels like my chest tightens, and I get a little shaky. Guilt shows up as a voice in my head telling me I should be more positive or more productive, instead of allowing myself to rest.

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very clear awareness—your body signaling these feelings. It sounds like there's a tension between your desire to care for yourself and the pressure to stay productive. How has this emotional experience affected your relationship with your partner lately?

[11:17] Zoë: We’ve had some tense moments. I notice I sometimes snap at him when I’m stressed, and then I feel bad about it afterward. He’s been supportive but also seems a bit distant at times, probably because he’s worried about me.

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common dynamic during stressful periods—your stress impacting your connection. It’s good that you’re aware of both your reactions and his. Would you like to explore how these emotions and interactions are affecting your relationship more deeply today?

[11:22] Zoë: Yes, I think that would help. I want to find ways to communicate better and also manage my stress so I don’t push him away or get overwhelmed.

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s start with a brief exercise. I’d like you to imagine you’re describing your current emotional state to your partner. What would you want him to know, if you could say it openly?

[11:27] Zoë: Hmm… I’d tell him that I’m feeling anxious about the fertility treatments, tired from the emotional rollercoaster, and that sometimes I get overwhelmed and need patience and understanding. I’d want him to know that it’s not him, but everything I’m going through.

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very compassionate message. How do you feel about sharing that with him? Do you think you could express it in a way that feels authentic to you?

[11:32] Zoë: I think I could try. I’ve been practicing some “I” statements, like “I feel anxious when…” and “I need some support right now.” It’s a start.

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Using “I” statements can really help communicate your feelings without blame. Let’s also look at some ways to support your emotional resilience. You mentioned stress and fatigue—what self-care strategies have you been using, and are they helpful?

[11:37] Zoë: I’ve been doing meditation in the mornings, which helps a bit. Also, journaling some feelings during the day. But I find it hard to slow down when work is so demanding.

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to struggle with slowing down, especially during busy times. Would you be open to exploring some brief grounding exercises you can do during the day when stress spikes? Maybe even a quick pause to check in with your body?

[11:42] Zoë: Yes, I’d like that. Sometimes I forget to pause until I’m already overwhelmed.

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: Let’s try a simple exercise now. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, take a deep breath, and notice where you feel tension in your body. Can you identify one spot—perhaps your shoulders, chest, or stomach?

(Zoë closes her eyes briefly)

[11:47] Zoë: I think my shoulders feel tight, and my chest feels a bit heavy.

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Good. Now, take a slow breath into that area—imagine sending your breath there. As you exhale, imagine releasing some of that tension. How does that feel?

[11:52] Zoë: It helps a little. I can feel some of the tightness easing.

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a simple yet effective grounding technique. Practicing this during your day can help you manage stress in real time. How does that sound?

[11:57] Zoë: It sounds doable. I’ll try to remember to pause for a minute when I feel overwhelmed.

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Now, looking ahead, I’d like us to think about how you can create a support network—people you can lean on when things get tough. Have you identified anyone recently, perhaps friends or family, who can offer understanding?

[12:02] Zoë: I’ve talked to my sister a bit. She’s been through fertility struggles herself, so she gets it. I also joined a support group online, which helps to hear others’ experiences.

[12:05] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful. Connecting with others who understand your journey can be very validating. How do you feel about sharing your feelings with your partner more openly, or perhaps setting aside time for just the two of you to connect without distractions?

[12:07] Zoë: I’d like to do that. We’ve been so busy, and I think we’ve been avoiding some of the deeper conversations. I want to make space for us.

[12:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a positive goal. Maybe scheduling a regular time to check in with each other could help rebuild that connection. How does that sound?

[12:12] Zoë: Yes, I think that would help. Even just 15 minutes a day to talk honestly.

[12:15] Dr. Bianchi: Perfect. To summarize, your action steps are: continue practicing the grounding exercise during stressful moments, share your feelings with your partner using “I” statements, and set aside regular time for connection. Does that feel manageable?

[12:17] Zoë: Yes, it does. I feel more hopeful already, knowing I have some tools to handle things better.

[12:20] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. We’ll continue to work on these areas in our next session. Before we finish today, do you have any questions or anything else you’d like to share?

[12:22] Zoë: No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Serena. I appreciate the support.

[12:25] Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome, Zoë. I admire your resilience and willingness to work through these challenges. Take care this week, and I look forward to seeing you next time.

[12:27] Zoë: Thanks. See you next week.
