[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Zoë offers a small smile, looking a bit tired but engaged)  

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and with everything going on with my fertility treatments, I’ve felt kind of drained. But I’m glad to be here today.  

[11:05] Dr. Serena Bianchi: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you’ve been juggling a lot lately—work stress and your fertility journey. Would you like to start by telling me what’s been most prominent for you emotionally this week?  

[11:07] Zoë: I think the biggest thing is feeling overwhelmed. There are moments I feel hopeful, especially when I see progress with the treatments, but then I get hit with anxiety about whether it’s enough or if it’s going to work at all. And that anxiety sometimes spills over into my relationship with Jamie.  

[11:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That sounds really challenging—being caught between hope and fear. When you notice that anxiety spilling over into your relationship, how does that typically manifest?  

[11:12] Zoë: I think I become more irritable, less patient. Last night, Jamie tried to talk about planning a weekend getaway, and I snapped a little because I just felt overwhelmed and not in the right headspace. I hate that I sometimes shut down or get defensive.  

[11:15] Dr. Serena Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed given everything you’re managing. You mentioned feeling hopeful at times—what helps you reconnect with that sense of hope during difficult days?  

[11:17] Zoë: Meditation has been somewhat helpful. Just taking a few minutes to breathe and focus on what I can control. Also, journaling my feelings helps me process. But I notice that when stress piles up, it’s harder to stay grounded.  

[11:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a really valuable insight—recognizing your tools and their limits. You mentioned journaling; do you find it helps you understand your emotions better or just releases some of the tension?  

[11:22] Zoë: Both, really. It helps me sort through what I’m feeling and sometimes identify patterns—like, I realize I get more anxious when I feel I’m not doing enough at work or in my treatment.  

[11:25] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s great awareness. Last time, we talked about emotional tracking and noticing your feelings as they come and go. How has that been going? Have you been able to keep up with it?  

[11:27] Zoë: Yes, I’ve been doing it daily. It’s interesting—sometimes I notice that my anxiety spikes around certain triggers, like when I see a friend announce their pregnancy or when I get a bad update from my doctor. Recognizing these triggers helps me step back a little.  

[11:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a significant step—identifying triggers and responses. How do you usually respond when you notice those spikes? Do you have any specific strategies to manage them in the moment?  

[11:32] Zoë: I try to breathe deeply and remind myself that these feelings are temporary. Sometimes I reach out to Jamie to talk, which helps. But other times, I just need a moment alone.  

[11:35] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Those are effective grounding techniques—deep breathing and seeking support from Jamie. You mentioned earlier that your relationship sometimes feels strained under stress. How are you and Jamie doing overall?  

[11:37] Zoë: I think we’re good, but I worry that all this stress is building up without us realizing it. We’re still trying to stay connected, but I notice I’m less patient with him, especially when I’m feeling anxious.  

[11:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi: It’s normal for stress to impact patience and connection. What are some ways you and Jamie have been able to maintain intimacy or support lately?  

[11:42] Zoë: We’ve been trying to have small conversations about how we’re feeling, even if it’s just a quick check-in. We also try to do something relaxing together—like watching a show or taking a walk. But I know we could do more.  

[11:45] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a good start—small, intentional moments. Based on what you’ve shared, it might help to develop a regular “check-in” routine, maybe a brief, shared emotional review a couple of times a week. Would that be something you’d like to explore?  

[11:47] Zoë: Yeah, I think that could help. Sometimes I hold things in until I explode, so having a scheduled moment might prevent that.  

[11:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Exactly. Creating space for ongoing emotional dialogue can strengthen your bond and help manage stress more proactively. Before we wrap up today, what’s one thing you want to focus on before our next session?  

[11:52] Zoë: I want to keep tracking my emotions and start that regular check-in with Jamie. Also, I’d like to try a new self-care activity—maybe a longer meditation or some gentle yoga.  

[11:55] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Those sound like excellent goals. Remember, self-care is vital, especially during this demanding time. We’ll also work on some communication exercises to support your relationship. How does that sound?  

[11:57] Zoë: It sounds good. Thank you, Serena. I already feel a bit more grounded just talking about everything today.  

[11:59] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s wonderful to hear, Zoë. I’m glad you’re feeling more grounded. Let’s continue building on this progress next week. Take care until then.  

[12:00] Zoë: Thanks, you too. See you next week.
