[11:00]  
Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. I’ve been managing okay. The fertility treatments have been stressful, but I’ve tried to keep up with my journaling and meditation. (pauses, looks thoughtful) It’s a bit of a rollercoaster, honestly.  

Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. I remember you mentioning last time how the treatments often bring up a lot of feelings—hope, frustration, fear. How have those been lately?  

Zoë: Well, I’d say I’m mostly feeling anxious. Yesterday, I saw my fertility app notification reminding me to take my meds, and I just felt overwhelmed. Like, this is never-ending. (smiles faintly) It’s hard to stay hopeful sometimes.  

Dr. Bianchi: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Your body and mind are under a lot of pressure. Would you like to explore what those feelings look like right now? Maybe identify some specific emotions you’re experiencing?  

Zoë: Yeah. I think I mostly feel anxious, a bit hopeless, and sometimes lonely. Like I’m doing this all alone, even though I know my partner is supportive.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very honest and important recognition. Feeling lonely despite support can be really tough. How have you been expressing or processing these emotions lately?  

Zoë: I’ve been journaling quite a bit, especially after appointments. It helps to get my feelings out. Also, I’ve started tracking my mood in an app. But I haven’t really talked about these feelings much outside of my journal.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start—using journaling and mood tracking as ways to process. Sometimes, externalizing emotions helps us see patterns or triggers. Have you noticed any particular times or situations that bring up stronger feelings?  

Zoë: Yes, definitely. When I hear about friends or colleagues announcing pregnancies, I feel a pang of envy and sadness. And work has been challenging lately—I feel guilty taking time off for appointments, but also guilty for not being fully present when I’m there.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common experience—feeling torn between different aspects of life. It sounds like your work and social circles sometimes amplify feelings of loss or inadequacy. Would you say your stress about work is also affecting your relationship?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think so. I notice I’m more irritable with my partner lately, especially after stressful days. I don’t mean to take it out on him, but I can’t seem to help it.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s an important insight—recognizing how stress impacts your interactions. How does your partner respond when you’re irritable?  

Zoë: He tries to be patient, but I can tell he’s worried about me. Sometimes he just gives me space, but other times he asks what’s wrong, and I don’t really know how to explain all of this.  

Dr. Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel uncertain about how to communicate these complex feelings. Have you and your partner used any specific ways of talking about your needs or feelings during this time?  

Zoë: Not really. We’ve kind of avoided deep conversations about it, to avoid adding more stress. But I think that’s making us both feel more distant.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common pattern—avoidance to protect oneself, which can unintentionally create distance. Moving forward, it might help to develop some communication tools to share your feelings gently but honestly. Would you be open to practicing a simple exercise for that?  

Zoë: Yes, I’d like that.  

Dr. Bianchi: Great. We can try a "Feeling and Need" statement. For example, you might say, “I’m feeling anxious and lonely because I’m worried about my fertility, and I need reassurance and understanding.” Would you like to try crafting one now?  

Zoë: Sure. (pauses, then speaks softly) "I’m feeling overwhelmed and exhausted from the fertility treatments, and I need my partner to know that I appreciate his support and patience."  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a beautiful start, Zoë. It conveys your feelings clearly and expresses a need for support. Would you feel comfortable sharing that with your partner?  

Zoë: I think I could try. I’ve been avoiding those conversations, but I see now how important they are.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a significant step. How about we also explore some self-care strategies you can use during stressful moments? For example, grounding exercises or brief mindfulness routines?  

Zoë: Yes, I’ve tried some meditation apps, but I haven’t been consistent. Maybe I could incorporate a quick breathing exercise during the day when I feel anxious.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good idea. Even a few deep breaths can help reset your nervous system. Would you like me to guide you through a short breathing exercise now?  

Zoë: Sure, I’d like that.  

[11:10]  
Dr. Bianchi: Okay. Let’s do a simple box breathing technique. Inhale slowly through your nose for four counts… (pauses) …hold your breath for four counts… (pauses) …exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts… (pauses) …and hold again for four counts. Let’s do that together a couple of times.  

(They proceed with a brief guided breathing practice)  

Zoë: That actually helped. I feel a bit calmer already.  

Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Remember, these small moments can really add up over the day. Now, thinking about the future, what would you like to focus on in our upcoming sessions?  

Zoë: I think I want to work more on balancing my work and personal life, and also strengthening our communication as a couple. I want us to feel closer despite everything.  

Dr. Bianchi: Those sound like meaningful goals. We’ve made good progress today in acknowledging your feelings and practicing some coping tools. Before we end, I’ll give you a couple of homework assignments: continue with your journaling and mood tracking, practice the breathing exercise daily, and try sharing your feelings with your partner using the “Feeling and Need” statement.  

Zoë: That sounds good. I’ll try to do that. Thanks, Serena.  

Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome, Zoë. You’re doing brave work. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll check in on how those new strategies are working for you.  

Zoë: Looking forward to it. Have a good week.  

Dr. Bianchi: You too. Take care.
