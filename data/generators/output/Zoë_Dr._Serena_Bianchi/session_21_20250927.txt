[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any particular moments or feelings you'd like to start with today?

[11:02] Zoë: Hi Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The stress around my fertility treatments has been intense, and I’ve felt pretty exhausted emotionally. Work has been busy too, so I’m juggling a lot.

[11:04] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds really demanding. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when juggling such significant stressors. Do you notice any specific emotions coming up most often during these times?

[11:05] Zoë: Mostly anxiety and sadness. Sometimes frustration—especially when I see others around me getting pregnant easily. It makes me feel isolated, like I’m not doing enough or failing in some way.

[11:07] Dr. Bianchi: Those feelings of anxiety and sadness are quite natural given your situation. You mentioned feeling isolated—can you tell me more about how that shows up for you in your relationship?

[11:09] Zoë: Yeah, my partner tries to be supportive, but I think he’s also overwhelmed. Sometimes I catch myself withdrawing because I don’t want to burden him with my feelings, and then I feel guilty for shutting him out.

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common experience—wanting to protect your loved ones but feeling isolated at the same time. How has your communication been with him about these feelings?

[11:12] Zoë: Not great. I’ve been avoiding deep conversations because I don’t want to seem needy, but I realize that’s making us drift apart. I think we’re both holding back.

[11:14] Dr. Bianchi: It’s very insightful of you to notice that. Last time, we talked about expressing emotions openly, even small feelings. Have you tried any new approaches with him since then?

[11:16] Zoë: I attempted to share a little more last week, like telling him I was feeling anxious about the upcoming appointment. It felt vulnerable but also relieving afterward. He listened well, which was reassuring.

[11:17] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great step forward, Zoë. Vulnerability can be challenging but often leads to deeper connection. How did sharing that feeling impact your interaction afterward?

[11:19] Zoë: It made us feel closer. He said he appreciated my honesty and that he wants to be there for me, even if he doesn’t always know what to say.

[11:21] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful progress. It sounds like openness is strengthening your bond. How are you managing your own emotional self-care amidst these stressors?

[11:23] Zoë: I’ve been trying to meditate more and keep a journal, but some days I just feel drained. I also sometimes use my fertility app to track everything, which helps me feel a bit more in control.

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: Using your apps as a form of control and reassurance makes sense. How do you feel about balancing your work commitments with the emotional demands of your fertility journey?

[11:27] Zoë: It’s tough. I’ve had to set boundaries at work, like turning off notifications after hours, but I still find myself thinking about it during meetings. I worry about how stress is affecting my body and my chances.

[11:29] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very aware observation. Managing stress is crucial, especially during fertility treatments. Have you noticed any specific triggers at work or outside that heighten your anxiety?

[11:31] Zoë: Deadlines and emails can be overwhelming, especially when I’m already feeling fragile. Sometimes I get into a spiral of ‘what ifs’—what if this doesn’t work, what if I can’t handle it.

[11:33] Dr. Bianchi: Those ‘what if’ thoughts can be very draining. Would you be open to exploring some grounding techniques or cognitive strategies to manage those spirals?

[11:35] Zoë: Yes, I’d like that. I’ve heard of some mindfulness exercises, but I haven’t tried them consistently.

[11:36] Dr. Bianchi: We can certainly work on those today. Also, I’d like us to revisit your support network—who else do you turn to when feeling overwhelmed?

[11:38] Zoë: My sister has been a good listener, and I have a couple of friends I can talk to. But I usually don’t want to burden them too much, so I keep a lot inside.

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Sometimes, sharing with close others can lessen feelings of isolation. We’ll explore ways to help you feel comfortable reaching out without feeling like you’re overloading them. 

[11:42] Zoë: That would be helpful. I want to feel more connected and less alone in this.

[11:43] Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely. Over the past sessions, we’ve been working on emotion tracking and communication. How do you feel about your progress in recognizing and expressing your feelings?

[11:45] Zoë: I think I’m getting better at identifying what I feel, even if I still struggle to share it sometimes. The emotion tracking has helped me see patterns, like when I tend to feel anxious or sad.

[11:47] Dr. Bianchi: That awareness is a significant step. Recognizing patterns allows you to anticipate and intervene early. How might this insight help you in your relationship and self-care?

[11:49] Zoë: Maybe I can catch myself earlier when I start spiraling and try some of the grounding techniques we talked about. Also, sharing my feelings more openly could bring us closer.

[11:51] Dr. Bianchi: Exactly. Building on that, I’d like us to set a small goal for the next week—perhaps to share one feeling with your partner each day or practice a grounding exercise when stress peaks.

[11:53] Zoë: I like that. I think I can do that. It feels manageable.

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Before we finish, how are you feeling overall today?

[11:56] Zoë: A bit more hopeful. It’s comforting to have a space to process all this.

[11:58] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is often gradual, and you’re doing really well navigating these challenges. Next session, we’ll continue strengthening these skills and explore any new feelings that come up.

[12:00] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I appreciate your support. I’ll work on sharing one feeling each day and practicing grounding.

[12:02] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Take care, Zoë, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week.

[12:03] Zoë: Thanks, see you then.
