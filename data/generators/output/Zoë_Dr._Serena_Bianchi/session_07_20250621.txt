[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Zoë: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel more hopeful, but other days, the stress about everything—fertility, work, and relationship—just hits hard.  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable to have fluctuating feelings with such a lot on your plate. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been most prominent for you this week?  

Zoë: I think… I’ve been feeling more anxious about balancing my work deadlines with my fertility treatments. I caught myself thinking I was neglecting my self-care routines, like meditation and journaling, because I was so busy.  

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: Noticing that you’re neglecting your self-care is important. How does that make you feel?  

Zoë: Honestly, a bit guilty. Like I’m slipping on the things that used to help me stay grounded. At the same time, I feel this pressure to perform well at work, especially since I recently took on a new project.  

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like you’re feeling torn between your responsibilities and your needs for self-compassion. Have you been able to identify any specific moments when the stress becomes overwhelming?  

Zoë: Yeah, usually late afternoons. I get home, and I just want to shut down, but then I feel guilty for not “being productive” or “relaxing properly,” whatever that means. Sometimes I just end up scrolling through my fertility apps feeling more anxious.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very insightful observation—that you notice a pattern in the late afternoons. It sounds like those moments are particularly tough. How do you usually respond to that feeling of guilt or anxiety?  

Zoë: I tend to either push through and try to distract myself, or I get really self-critical, like “Why can’t I handle this better?” It’s like I’m caught in a loop.  

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common response when we’re overwhelmed. Let’s try to pause and bring some awareness to those moments. Would you be comfortable exploring what’s happening emotionally when you notice yourself scrolling or feeling self-critical?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think so. I guess I feel a mix of frustration and sadness—like I’m failing at taking care of myself and this whole journey.  

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: Those are very valid feelings. Sometimes, naming what we’re experiencing can help us feel more grounded. Can you try to describe that frustration and sadness in a sentence or two?  

Zoë: Hmm… I’d say, “I feel frustrated because I can’t control the timing, and sad because I’m worried I’m losing myself in the process.”  

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a powerful expression, Zoë. It shows awareness of both your emotional state and the underlying fears. How might you honor these feelings without judgment?  

Zoë: Maybe by telling myself it’s okay to feel this way—that I’m allowed to have these difficult emotions without beating myself up.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: Exactly. Allowing space for those feelings can reduce their intensity over time. Now, earlier you mentioned work stress affecting your balance. How is your current workload, and are there ways to create more boundaries?  

Zoë: It’s manageable, but I’ve been working late more often. I think I need to set clearer limits, but I worry about letting my team down.  

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common concern. Setting boundaries is essential for your well-being. Have you considered communicating your needs to your team, or maybe scheduling specific times for work and self-care?  

Zoë: I haven’t really done that explicitly, but I could try. Maybe informing my manager that I need to protect certain hours for personal appointments or rest.  

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a strong step. Remember, advocating for your needs is a form of self-respect and sustainability. Now, over the past sessions, we’ve talked about emotion tracking and journaling. How consistent have you been with those practices?  

Zoë: I’ve been okay, but honestly, I’ve skipped some days when I felt overwhelmed. I think I need to make it more routine.  

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: Consistency can be challenging, especially during stressful times. Perhaps integrating a brief check-in—like a five-minute reflection—into your daily routine could help you stay connected with your feelings. Would that work for you?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think I can do that. Maybe in the mornings or before bed.  

Dr. Bianchi: Great. Also, remember that self-compassion is key. When you notice yourself slipping into guilt or self-criticism, try to pause and gently remind yourself that you’re doing your best in a difficult situation.  

Zoë: That’s helpful. I’ll try to be kinder to myself.  

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: Wonderful. As we approach the end of our session, let’s set a couple of actionable steps. First, try to establish a clear boundary with your work schedule—perhaps by communicating your availability to your team. Second, implement a brief daily emotion check-in, maybe in the morning or evening. How does that sound?  

Zoë: That sounds doable. I feel more hopeful already.  

[12:05] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress isn’t linear, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Next week, we can explore how these new strategies are working for you and address any new feelings that come up.  

Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I appreciate your support.  

Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome, Zoë. Take care of yourself this week, and I look forward to seeing you next time.  

Zoë: Thanks, see you next week. (smiles softly)
