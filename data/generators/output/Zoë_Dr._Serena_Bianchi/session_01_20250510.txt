[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it's been a mixed week. Some days I feel more hopeful, but others, I just feel overwhelmed, especially with everything going on with the fertility treatments and work.  

[11:04] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That sounds quite exhausting. It’s understandable to feel fluctuating emotions given the stressors you're navigating. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been most prominent for you lately?  

[11:07] Zoë: Well, I’ve been tracking my emotions with my journal and app, and I notice a lot of anxiety around the fertility process—like, I’m constantly waiting for test results or appointments, and it’s hard not to dwell on the what-ifs. Also, I worry about how this stress is affecting my relationship with my partner.  

[11:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi: It’s good that you’re tracking your feelings—that’s a helpful step. When you mention anxiety and worry, where do you feel that most in your body?  

[11:12] Zoë: (pauses) I think it’s mostly in my chest, like a tightness, and sometimes I get headaches from it. It’s like I carry this weight all the time.  

[11:15] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That physical sensation of tightness can be very telling. It sounds like your body is holding a lot of tension. When you notice that, how do you usually respond? Do you try to push through, or do you have ways to soothe yourself?  

[11:18] Zoë: I’ve been trying to meditate, especially in the mornings, but honestly, it’s hard to quiet my mind when I’m so worried about the future. Sometimes I just end up feeling more anxious afterward because I dwell on what I couldn't clear out.  

[11:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a very common experience. Meditation can sometimes bring up worries rather than diminish them, especially when the mind is busy. Would you be open to exploring some emotion-focused techniques that might help you process these feelings more deeply?  

[11:23] Zoë: Yes, I’d like that. I think understanding my emotions better could help me manage them.  

[11:25] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Great. Let’s try a quick exercise now. I want you to think about a recent moment when you felt especially anxious or overwhelmed. Can you recall a specific incident?  

[11:28] Zoë: Yes, yesterday I received a call from my doctor about some test results. I was alone at work, and my heart started pounding. I felt this surge of fear because I didn’t know what the results would say.  

[11:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Thank you for sharing that. As you recall that moment, can you identify the primary emotion you're experiencing?  

[11:33] Zoë: It’s fear, definitely. Like a deep, primal fear of not knowing what’s next.  

[11:35] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s very insightful. Now, let’s explore that fear a little more. If you could give that fear a shape or a color, what would it be?  

[11:38] Zoë: Hmm... maybe a dark, heavy cloud? It feels like this shadow looming over me.  

[11:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a powerful image. When you see that cloud, what does it tell you about what you need right now?  

[11:43] Zoë: I think it’s telling me I need to acknowledge that feeling instead of pushing it away. Like, I have to let myself feel it fully to process it.  

[11:45] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Exactly. Allowing yourself to sit with that emotion, rather than suppressing it, can be very healing. Do you find that helpful?  

[11:48] Zoë: Yes, actually. It gives me a bit of space. Like I’m not just drowning in anxiety; I’m observing it.  

[11:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a great step. Over time, this kind of emotion tracking can help you build resilience. Now, shifting a bit—how is your communication with your partner about these stressors?  

[11:54] Zoë: We try to talk about it, but sometimes I feel like I’m not sharing enough, or I hold back because I don’t want to worry him. But then, I think that makes us more distant.  

[11:58] Dr. Serena Bianchi: It’s understandable to want to protect your partner from worry. But sharing your feelings honestly can actually bring you closer, especially during difficult times. Would you like to practice a brief communication exercise now?  

[12:00] Zoë: Sure, I’d like that.  

[12:02] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Great. I’ll guide you. Think of a recent situation where you felt you could have shared more openly. Could be about your feelings or needs.  

[12:05] Zoë: Well, last week I was feeling overwhelmed at work but didn’t tell my partner how much I was struggling. I just said I was busy.  

[12:07] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Okay. Now, imagine approaching that conversation again, but this time, expressing your feelings honestly. I’ll help you craft a simple statement.  

[12:10] Zoë: (nodding) Okay.  

[12:12] Dr. Serena Bianchi: You might say, “I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with everything going on—work, fertility, and the stress is building up. I need your support and understanding right now.” How does that sound?  

[12:15] Zoë: That feels good. It’s honest but not too heavy. I think he would understand.  

[12:17] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Excellent. Practicing this kind of openness can strengthen your connection. Moving forward, how comfortable do you feel about setting aside time for self-care and relaxation amid your busy schedule?  

[12:20] Zoë: Honestly, not very. I feel guilty taking time for myself when there’s so much to do. But I know I need it.  

[12:22] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Guilt is common, but self-care is essential, especially now. Small, intentional moments—like a few minutes of deep breathing or a short walk—can make a big difference. Would you like to establish a simple self-care plan for the coming week?  

[12:25] Zoë: Yes, I’d like that. Maybe I can commit to a five-minute breathing exercise each morning.  

[12:27] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a great start. Remember, it’s about consistency, not perfection. Before we finish today, let’s briefly review your goals.  

[12:30] Zoë: Sure. I want to manage my stress better, communicate more openly with my partner, and find ways to take better care of myself during this fertility journey.  

[12:33] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Those are excellent, clear goals. Over the next few weeks, we’ll work on strengthening your emotional resilience, enhancing communication, and developing personalized self-care strategies.  

[12:36] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I already feel a bit more hopeful just talking about these things.  

[12:38] Dr. Serena Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing important work. Our next session will focus on deepening these techniques and exploring your support network further.  

[12:40] Zoë: Sounds good. Thanks again.  

[12:42] Dr. Serena Bianchi: You’re very welcome. Take care this week, Zoë, and practice that breathing exercise. See you next week.  

[12:45] Zoë: Will do. Have a great day.  

[12:47] Dr. Serena Bianchi: You too. Goodbye.
