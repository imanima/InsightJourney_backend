**[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Good morning, Zoë. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
**Zoë:** Hi, Serena. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also some moments of calm. The fertility treatments are ongoing, and work has been intense lately.  

**[11:05] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That sounds like a lot to juggle. When you say overwhelmed, are there particular moments or feelings that stand out for you?  
**Zoë:** Yeah, I think it’s mostly the stress about balancing everything — the appointments, the emotional toll of waiting, and trying to stay present with my partner. Sometimes I feel like I’m on autopilot.  

**[11:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with so much uncertainty. Last time, we discussed using emotion tracking to identify your feelings more clearly. Have you been able to practice that?  
**Zoë:** I have, a bit. I’ve kept a digital journal — noting when I feel anxious, hopeful, or drained. It’s helped me notice patterns, like feeling more anxious after long work days or when I miss a fertility appointment.  

**[11:15] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a great start. Recognizing these patterns can give you insight into how your stress manifests. How do you feel about sharing some of those recent entries? Maybe we can explore what they tell us.  
**Zoë:** Sure. (She picks up her phone briefly.) Yesterday, I wrote “Feeling exhausted and hopeful at the same time — like I’m carrying both emotions in my chest.” It’s strange because I want to feel hope, but exhaustion makes it hard.  

**[11:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a powerful reflection. Feeling hope and exhaustion simultaneously can create a kind of emotional tension. Do you notice any particular triggers for these conflicting feelings?  
**Zoë:** Usually, after a long day of work, especially if I’ve had back-to-back meetings or if I’ve received some uncertain news about the fertility results. It’s like my body and mind are both craving rest but also holding onto hope.  

**[11:25] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That tension sounds exhausting. It’s a lot for anyone. Let’s consider how you can nurture self-care during these times. Have you tried any specific strategies to soothe yourself?  
**Zoë:** I’ve started meditating in the mornings, just 10-15 minutes. It helps me get grounded, but sometimes I skip it when I feel overwhelmed. Also, I try to connect with my partner, but I notice I sometimes withdraw when I’m stressed.  

**[11:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a common response — withdrawal when overwhelmed. It’s good that you’re aware of it. How would you describe your current relationship dynamic during this fertility journey?  
**Zoë:** It’s a bit strained. We’re both trying to stay supportive, but I think I’m not always communicating what I need. I tend to keep things inside, especially when I’m worried about disappointing him or myself.  

**[11:35] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That internalization can make you feel more isolated. Remember, sharing your feelings, even the difficult ones, can strengthen your connection. Have you and your partner discussed how you’re both coping emotionally?  
**Zoë:** Not in detail. We’ve talked about the logistics, but not much about how we’re really feeling inside. I think I’m afraid of adding more weight to him, since he’s also stressed about work and fertility.  

**[11:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a compassionate instinct, but opening up might also bring relief. Sometimes, vulnerability can deepen intimacy, especially in tough times. Would you be open to practicing a gentle sharing exercise with him?  
**Zoë:** Maybe. I’d like to try, but I’m worried about how he’ll respond. I don’t want to burden him more.  

**[11:45] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** It’s understandable to feel cautious. How about we plan a small, structured way to share — maybe just expressing one feeling or need? And I can help you craft that message. Would that feel manageable?  
**Zoë:** Yes, I think I can do that. It’s a start.  

**[11:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Great. Now, shifting a bit — you’ve mentioned work has been intense, and balancing that with your personal life is challenging. How are you managing boundaries around work lately?  
**Zoë:** Honestly, I’ve been working late a lot, responding to emails in the evenings. It’s hard to disconnect, especially when I have fertility treatments scheduled. It feels like I’m constant.  

**[11:55] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That sounds draining. Setting clearer boundaries might help create space for rest and recovery. Have you thought about specific steps, like designated “tech-free” times or creating a ritual to mark the end of your workday?  
**Zoë:** I’ve considered it, but I haven’t implemented it yet. Maybe I could try turning off notifications after a certain hour or establishing a relaxing routine.  

**[12:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Those are excellent ideas. Even small changes can make a difference. Let’s also revisit your self-care routines — how are your meditation and journaling practices going?  
**Zoë:** They’re okay. I do them sometimes, but not consistently. When I’m stressed, I feel like I don’t have time or I forget.  

**[12:05] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Consistency can be challenging, especially now. Perhaps integrating brief mindfulness moments into your day — like a minute of deep breathing or a quick gratitude note — could help. Would you like to explore some simple techniques?  
**Zoë:** Yes, I’d like that. Anything to help me stay grounded.  

**[12:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Perfect. Before we wrap up today, I want to acknowledge your resilience. You’re navigating a tough journey with a lot of awareness and compassion. What’s one thing you feel proud of since our last session?  
**Zoë:** I think I’m proud that I’ve kept tracking my emotions, even when it’s uncomfortable. It’s helping me understand myself better.  

**[12:15] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s wonderful. Recognizing your progress is important. For next steps, I’d like you to try one small boundary around work, and practice sharing one feeling with your partner this week. How does that sound?  
**Zoë:** That sounds doable. Thank you, Serena. I feel more hopeful already.  

**[12:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear that. We’ll check in on how these efforts feel next time. Take care of yourself this week, Zoë. Remember, it’s okay to lean on your support network.  
**Zoë:** Thank you. I’ll do that. See you next week.
