[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it's great to see you again. I can't believe we're at the 24th session already. How have you been feeling since our last check-in? 

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days are better than others. I’ve been trying to stay grounded, but the stress around fertility treatments is still pretty intense. 

[11:04] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Fertility journeys can really test emotional resilience. Have you noticed any specific triggers or moments that make the stress feel more overwhelming? 

[11:06] Zoë: Yeah, sometimes it’s when I see social media posts or hear friends talk about pregnancy announcements. It kind of hits me unexpectedly, and I feel this wave of sadness or frustration. 

[11:08] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very natural reaction, Zoë. It sounds like those moments trigger a lot of emotion. Have you been able to identify what feelings come up most strongly? 

[11:10] Zoë: Mostly sadness, but also a bit of anger at the situation. Sometimes guilt, like I should be more positive or grateful. It’s confusing trying to manage all these feelings at once. 

[11:12] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a lot to hold. It’s good you’re recognizing these emotions—they’re important signals. How have you been coping with this emotional load, especially during your workday? 

[11:14] Zoë: I’ve been trying to use my meditation app, which helps some days. But honestly, work has been pretty demanding, and it’s hard to switch off. I often feel guilty for not being more present with my partner or myself. 

[11:16] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like you’re balancing a lot—the stress from fertility, work demands, and relationship concerns. Have you noticed any patterns in how stress shows up in your body or mind? 

[11:18] Zoë: Yes, I tend to get headaches and a tight chest when things get overwhelming. Mentally, I catch myself ruminating about all the “what ifs” and future worries. 

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: Those physical and mental signs are important clues. When you notice these signs, what do you usually do? Do you have any go-to strategies? 

[11:22] Zoë: I try to take a few deep breaths or step away for a quick walk. Sometimes I journal what I’m feeling. But I feel like I could use more consistent tools to manage these moments better. 

[11:24] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start, Zoë. Building a set of reliable coping strategies can help you feel more in control. We’ve talked before about emotion tracking—have you been keeping up with that? 

[11:26] Zoë: Yes, I’ve been using my digital journal to note my mood and triggers. I’ve noticed that on days when I acknowledge my feelings openly, I feel a bit more grounded. 

[11:28] Dr. Bianchi: That’s an important insight. Acknowledging emotions rather than suppressing them can promote emotional resilience. How does that connect with your relationship? Are you feeling more able to share your feelings with your partner? 

[11:30] Zoë: I think so. I’ve been making an effort to be more honest about what I’m feeling, especially when I’m overwhelmed. Sometimes he responds well, but other times he seems unsure how to help. 

[11:32] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common experience. It’s great that you’re practicing honesty. Have you and your partner discussed what kind of support feels most helpful to you during these stressful times? 

[11:34] Zoë: We’ve talked a little about it, but not in depth. I think I’d like us to have more intentional conversations about how we can support each other better, especially around fertility stress. 

[11:36] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a wonderful idea. Creating a shared support plan can strengthen your connection and reduce misunderstandings. Would you be open to trying a communication exercise today to explore this? 

[11:38] Zoë: Yes, I’d like that. I think it could help us get clearer on what we both need. 

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: Great. We’ll do that shortly. Before we dive into the exercise, I want to acknowledge how much progress you’ve made over these months. You’ve developed awareness about your emotions and begun to implement strategies. How do you feel about your growth so far? 

[11:42] Zoë: Honestly, I’m proud of how far I’ve come. It’s been tough, but I feel more capable of handling the emotional ups and downs. I still have moments, but they’re less overwhelming. 

[11:44] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful to hear. Progress isn’t always linear, but your resilience shines through. Now, let’s move into that communication exercise to help you and your partner express needs and feelings more effectively. 

[11:46] Zoë: Sounds good. I’m ready. 

(They transition into the exercise, focusing on active listening and sharing support preferences.) 

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. After this, we’ll reflect on how it felt and set some next steps. Overall, Zoë, I want you to remember that your feelings are valid, and your efforts to nurture both yourself and your relationship are truly commendable. 

[11:52] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I really appreciate your support and guidance. It makes a difference knowing I’m not alone in this. 

[11:54] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. We’ll keep building on these skills. For next week, I’d like you to continue using your emotion journal and try the support conversation with your partner. How does that sound? 

[11:56] Zoë: That sounds doable. I’ll also think more about what kind of support I need specifically. 

[11:58] Dr. Bianchi: Perfect. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Looking forward to hearing how it goes. Have a wonderful week, Zoë. 

[12:00] Zoë: Thanks, Serena. See you next week.
