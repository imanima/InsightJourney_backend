**[11:00]**  
Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or particularly standing out this week?  

Zoë: Hi Dr. Bianchi. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The fertility treatments are really taking a toll emotionally, but I’ve been trying to keep busy with work. Some days feel more manageable than others.  

Dr. Bianchi: That sounds challenging. It’s understandable to have fluctuating feelings given everything you’re going through. Last time, we discussed some ways to track your emotions during the week. Have you noticed any patterns or particular triggers?  

Zoë: Yeah, I’ve definitely noticed that the days I’m more stressed at work—like when deadlines are tight or I’m stuck on a problem—those are the days I feel more anxious about the fertility stuff too. It’s like everything builds up.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s insightful. It’s common for stress in one area to spill over into others. When you recognize those days, is there anything you do differently?  

Zoë: I try to do some breathing exercises or take a quick walk, but honestly, sometimes I just get overwhelmed and can’t break out of the cycle. I also find that my partner, Sam, is more distant when I’m like that.  

Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like stress is impacting both your emotional state and your connection with Sam. How has your communication been with him about how you’re feeling?  

Zoë: Not great. I’ve been avoiding heavy talks because I don’t want to worry him more, but I realize that might not be helping. We kind of keep things surface-level, especially about the fertility stuff.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common pattern—avoiding difficult conversations. In our last session, we explored some ways to share feelings more openly. Would you like to practice a brief communication exercise now?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think that would help.  

**[11:10]**  
Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s try a simple "I feel" statement. Imagine you want to tell Sam that you’re feeling overwhelmed and need support. I’ll guide you through it.  

Zoë: Okay.  

Dr. Bianchi: Start with “I feel,” then add your emotion, and follow with what you need. For example, “I feel anxious when I don’t talk about how stressed I am, and I need some space to share my feelings.”  

Zoë: (pauses, then speaks) I feel overwhelmed when I don’t talk about how stressed I am, and I need some space to share my feelings.  

Dr. Bianchi: That was very clear and authentic, Zoë. How did it feel to say that?  

Zoë: A little nerve-wracking, honestly. But also, it felt good to put it into words. Like I’m starting to be more honest about what I need.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a big step. Remember, expressing your feelings calmly and clearly helps your partner understand what you’re going through. Would you like to practice saying it to Sam later, maybe in a role-play?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think that would be helpful.  

**[11:20]**  
Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Now, let’s look at how your work-life balance is holding up. You mentioned trying to stay busy, but does work help you feel in control, or does it sometimes add to your stress?  

Zoë: It’s a mix. I love my work, but lately, I feel like I’m using it to distract myself, which isn’t always healthy. Especially during tough fertility days, I catch myself checking my email constantly. It feels like a way to avoid feeling sad or anxious.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Distraction can be a short-term relief, but it’s important to find space for those emotions too. Have you tried any specific self-care routines or boundaries around work during these times?  

Zoë: I’ve started setting a "cut-off" time in the evening and turning off notifications. I also try to do a quick meditation, but I sometimes skip it if I’m feeling overwhelmed.  

Dr. Bianchi: Those are good strategies. Meditation can really help center you, especially during high-stress periods. Would you be open to a brief mindfulness exercise now?  

Zoë: Sure, I’d like that.  

**[11:30]**  
Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s do a 2-minute breath awareness exercise. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, focus on your breath, and notice the sensations of each inhale and exhale. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath.  

(Zoë closes her eyes, follows the breathing exercise)  

Dr. Bianchi: How do you feel after that?  

Zoë: More grounded. It’s a simple thing, but it helps clear some of the mental clutter.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful. Incorporating just a few minutes of this into your daily routine can be very beneficial. Now, thinking ahead, how do you feel about continuing to explore these emotional skills and communication techniques?  

Zoë: I want to keep working on it. I think the more I practice, the easier it’ll get to handle everything without feeling so overwhelmed.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great mindset. Progress takes time, and you’re already making meaningful strides. Before we wrap up, let’s set a couple of action items.  

Zoë: Okay.  

**[11:40]**  
Dr. Bianchi: First, try sharing your feelings with Sam using the “I feel” statement we practiced. Maybe write it out first, so you feel more prepared. Second, continue your mindfulness practice daily, even if just for a few minutes. And third, keep tracking your emotions and triggers—what’s working and what’s not.  

Zoë: Sounds good. I’ll do that.  

Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. And for next week, we can explore more about how to strengthen your support network and maybe address any lingering work-life boundary challenges. How does that sound?  

Zoë: Perfect. Thanks, Dr. Bianchi. I already feel a bit more hopeful just talking about it.  

Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that, Zoë. Remember, you’re making progress each week. See you next session.  

Zoë: See you.
