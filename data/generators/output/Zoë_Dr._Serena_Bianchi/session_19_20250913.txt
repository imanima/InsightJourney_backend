Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Zoë (UX Researcher)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Anything new or noteworthy this week?

[11:02] Zoë: Hi Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and with everything going on with the fertility treatments, I’ve felt pretty overwhelmed at times. But I’ve been trying to keep up with my journaling and meditation, so that helps.

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That’s good to hear you’re maintaining those practices. It sounds like you’re managing quite a bit. Can you tell me more about what’s been most challenging for you lately? 

[11:07] Zoë: Well, I think the biggest thing is balancing the stress from fertility treatments with my work. There are days I feel really anxious, especially when appointments overlap with deadlines. And sometimes I notice I’m shutting down emotionally with my partner, Sam, because I just don’t have the energy to talk about everything.

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: That makes sense. It sounds like the emotional load is quite heavy right now. I appreciate you sharing that. When you mention shutting down emotionally with Sam, can you tell me more about what that looks like? Are there specific moments or signs you notice?

[11:12] Zoë: Yeah. Usually, I become quieter, less responsive. Sometimes I avoid eye contact or change the subject. I know I’m doing it, but I can’t seem to break out of that pattern when I feel overwhelmed.

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like you’re aware of that pattern, which is a good first step. It’s common to want to withdraw when things feel too much. How does Sam respond when you withdraw like that?

[11:17] Zoë: He gets worried, I think. He asks if I’m okay or if I want to talk, but I just tell him I’m fine, even if I’m not. I don’t want to burden him, and sometimes I feel guilty for not being more open.

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very common experience—wanting to protect our loved ones but feeling isolated ourselves. How do you feel about sharing your feelings more openly with him, even when it’s hard?

[11:22] Zoë: I want to, but I also feel like I’m already carrying so much. Sometimes I think if I let him in more, I’d just be adding to both our stress. But I also know that bottling it up isn’t helping.

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: It’s a delicate balance. Remember, vulnerability can be a strength, especially in a partnership. We’ve talked before about using emotion tracking to recognize when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Have you noticed any specific emotions or physical signs lately that signal you’re heading toward that withdrawal?

[11:28] Zoë: Yeah, I’ve noticed my heart pounding during appointments, and I feel tense all over. Sometimes I catch myself thinking, “I just need a break,” and that’s when I start shutting down.

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s insightful. Recognizing those physical signs can help you intervene earlier. Perhaps we can explore some quick grounding techniques you can use when you notice these signs. How does that sound?

[11:32] Zoë: That sounds helpful. I’ve tried deep breathing, but I think I could use some more tools.

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely. We can practice some right now if you’d like. But before that, I want to check in on your support network. Who do you feel comfortable reaching out to when you need emotional support?

[11:37] Zoë: Mostly my sister, Emma. She’s been through similar fertility struggles, so she gets it. I also talk to a few close friends, but I don’t want to burden them too much.

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s good to identify those connections. It’s important to have safe spaces. And it’s okay to lean on others; you don’t have to carry everything alone. How about your relationship with Sam? Are there specific ways you’d like to strengthen your communication?

[11:42] Zoë: Yes, I think I need to be more honest about how exhausted I feel without feeling guilty. Sometimes I hold back because I don’t want him to worry, but I realize that might make him feel more helpless.

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very mature insight. Opening up gradually about your feelings can foster more understanding and support. We can work on some communication exercises today to help with that. Would you like to try a simple one now?

[11:47] Zoë: Sure, I’d like that.

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Great. I’ll guide you through a brief exercise. First, when you want to share something with Sam, start by expressing how you feel using “I” statements—for example, “I feel overwhelmed when…” or “I need some time to process…” Does that make sense?

[11:52] Zoë: Yes, I think I can do that.

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. And then, listen for his response without immediately jumping to solutions or advice. Just acknowledge his feelings as well. This can help build mutual understanding. Would you like to practice a hypothetical scenario now?

[11:57] Zoë: Sure, I can try.

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: Imagine you’re feeling anxious about an upcoming fertility appointment, and you want to share that with Sam. How might you start that conversation?

[12:02] Zoë: I might say, “Hey, I’ve been feeling pretty anxious about the appointment tomorrow. I just wanted to let you know how I’m feeling.”

[12:05] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a clear and honest start. How do you think Sam might respond?

[12:07] Zoë: Probably with concern, maybe asking if I want to talk more or if I need anything.

[12:09] Dr. Bianchi: That’s very supportive. Remember, it’s okay to ask for what you need—whether it’s just listening, a hug, or some space. How do you feel about trying to implement this approach in your real conversations?

[12:11] Zoë: I feel optimistic. It’s a bit scary, but I think it could help us be more connected.

[12:13] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a wonderful mindset. Over the next week, try to notice moments where you can use these “I” statements and practice sharing your feelings with Sam. Also, keep tracking your emotions and physical signs—you might find patterns that help you intervene earlier.

[12:15] Zoë: I will. And I’ll also reach out to Emma more when I need support.

[12:17] Dr. Bianchi: Perfect. Before we wrap up today, I’d like us to identify one self-care strategy you can incorporate daily to help with stress. Do you have any ideas?

[12:20] Zoë: I think I’ll try to set aside ten minutes each morning for meditation. It helped a bit last time, so I want to restart that habit.

[12:22] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great plan. Consistent self-care is vital during stressful times. And remember, I’m here to support you through this journey. For next week, let’s check in on how the meditation goes and any new insights about your communication with Sam.

[12:25] Zoë: Sounds good. Thanks, Serena. I feel a bit more hopeful after today.

[12:27] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. You’re making meaningful progress. See you next week, Zoë.

[12:28] Zoë: See you then.
