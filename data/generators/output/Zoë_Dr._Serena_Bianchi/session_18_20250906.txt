[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Any particular moments or feelings you'd like to share today?

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed these past few days. The fertility treatments are taking a toll emotionally, and work has been intense too. Sometimes I feel like I’m just juggling everything and not really catching a break.

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with all those demands. When you notice yourself feeling like that, what do you usually do to cope?

[11:07] Zoë: I try to meditate or journal, especially in the mornings. But lately, even those things haven’t helped much. I find my mind keeps racing, especially when I think about the next appointment or whether the treatment is working.

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like your mind is quite active, especially around those worries. Can you tell me more about what you’re feeling emotionally when you think about the fertility treatments? Are you experiencing hope, fear, frustration?

[11:12] Zoë: Mostly anxiety and frustration. I guess I feel hopeful sometimes, but it’s overshadowed by the fear of failure or disappointing my partner. It’s like I’m carrying a lot of weight emotionally.

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a heavy burden. It’s very human to feel that way, especially when dealing with such uncertainty. Last time, we talked about using emotion tracking to recognize these feelings as they come. Have you been able to do that, or notice any patterns?

[11:18] Zoë: I’ve been trying to, especially with my journaling. I notice that after certain appointments or when I’m working late, I tend to feel more anxious or irritable. Sometimes I catch myself withdrawing from my partner too.

[11:21] Dr. Bianchi: That’s insightful. Recognizing those patterns is a great step. How does your partner respond when you’re withdrawing or feeling overwhelmed? Are you able to share these feelings with him?

[11:23] Zoë: I try to, but I think I don’t always do it directly. I might just be quiet or avoid talking about the treatments because I don’t want to burden him. But I know that might be creating distance.

[11:26] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to want to protect loved ones from our distress, but sharing feelings often brings relief and connection. Would you like to explore some ways to communicate more openly with him about what you’re experiencing?

[11:28] Zoë: Yes, I think that would help. I just don’t always know how to start or if he’s even ready to hear it.

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Sometimes, framing it as sharing your feelings rather than expecting solutions can make it easier. For example, saying, “I’ve been feeling anxious about the treatments and need your support,” can open a dialogue. Would you like to practice that now?

[11:32] Zoë: Sure, I can try. (Pauses) Okay, I might say something like, "I’ve been feeling really anxious about everything lately, and I’d love to talk about it with you."

[11:34] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a strong start. Remember, expressing vulnerability can strengthen your connection. How do you feel about sharing that with him when you’re ready?

[11:36] Zoë: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful that it might bring us closer. I want us to support each other better.

[11:38] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a healthy goal. Now, considering your work-life balance, you mentioned feeling overwhelmed at work. How has that been affecting your stress levels overall?

[11:40] Zoë: It’s been tough. I’ve been working late to meet deadlines, but it leaves me exhausted, and I notice I’m less patient with my partner. I feel like I’m losing control of my time and energy.

[11:43] Dr. Bianchi: Managing energy is crucial, especially during such a demanding time. Have you thought about specific boundaries or self-care routines to protect your well-being?

[11:45] Zoë: I’ve considered setting stricter work hours and maybe scheduling more time for relaxing activities. But with ongoing projects, it’s hard to stick to those boundaries.

[11:47] Dr. Bianchi: It’s understandable. Sometimes, small, intentional shifts can make a difference. For example, dedicating even 10 minutes a day to mindful breathing or a brief walk can help restore some balance. Would you be willing to try that?

[11:50] Zoë: Yes, I can do that. I think I need to prioritize those moments more.

[11:52] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a positive step. Also, revisiting your support network—friends, family, or support groups—could provide additional relief. Have you reached out to anyone recently?

[11:55] Zoë: Not much. I’ve been so focused on treatments and work. But maybe I should reconnect with my sister or a friend who knows what I’m going through.

[11:57] Dr. Bianchi: Reaching out can lessen feelings of isolation and give you additional emotional resources. It’s important to remind yourself that you don’t have to carry everything alone.

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: To wrap up, let’s set some small action steps: first, practice sharing your feelings with your partner using the phrase we discussed. Second, commit to a brief daily self-care activity like mindful breathing. And third, consider reaching out to a trusted friend or family member this week. Does that sound manageable?

[12:02] Zoë: Yes, that sounds good. I feel optimistic about trying these.

[12:04] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Next time, we can explore how these new strategies are working and address any challenges you encounter. Remember, progress is often gradual, and each step counts. How are you feeling about the session today?

[12:06] Zoë: I feel more hopeful and a bit more in control. It’s helpful to have some concrete ideas.

[12:08] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Keep being gentle with yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care until then.

[12:10] Zoë: Thank you, Serena. See you next week.
