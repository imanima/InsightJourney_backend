Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Zoë (UX Researcher)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel more hopeful, but others I’m pretty overwhelmed, especially with everything going on with the fertility treatments and work.  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions, especially with such a demanding schedule. Would it help if we started by checking in on how you’ve been managing your stress these days?  
Zoë: Yeah, I think so. I’ve been trying to use my meditation app more regularly, especially in the mornings. It helps me ground myself before starting my workday. But sometimes, even with that, my mind just races.  

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s great that you’re using meditation as a tool. It shows your resilience. When your mind races, what specific thoughts tend to come up? Are they related to fertility, work, or something else?  
Zoë (pauses): Mostly, I think about the uncertainty with the fertility process—like, will it work this time? And also, I worry about balancing it all with my job. I want to perform well, but I also need to take care of myself emotionally.  

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a lot to carry. It’s good you’re aware of those thoughts. In our previous sessions, we worked on emotion tracking—have you found that helpful in identifying when these worries are intensifying?  
Zoë: Yes, definitely. I’ve started noting down when I feel anxious or overwhelmed, especially during meetings or when I get a call about my fertility updates. Seeing it on paper makes it a bit easier to understand my patterns.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s excellent progress. Recognizing your emotional patterns is a key step. How have you been communicating your needs with your partner during this time?  
Zoë (smiles softly): Honestly, it’s been a challenge. Sometimes I bottle things up, especially when I’m worried about seeming too vulnerable. But I’ve tried to share more openly about how stressed I am, especially after a recent appointment.  

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a big step—being more open. How does your partner respond when you share these feelings?  
Zoë: Usually, he’s very supportive, but I notice that I still hold back certain fears, like the possibility of needing to consider different options if things don’t work out. I guess I’m worried about burdening him.  

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Sometimes, our fears about burdening others can hold us back from fully expressing ourselves. Remember, vulnerability can strengthen your connection. Have you noticed any shifts in how you both approach difficult conversations?  
Zoë: A little. We’ve started using a shared timeline app to track appointments and feelings, which has helped us stay more aligned. It feels less like I’m carrying everything alone.  

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a wonderful tool. Using shared platforms can foster teamwork and reduce feelings of isolation. How are you managing your work-life balance lately, especially with the added stress?  
Zoë: Honestly, it’s tricky. I’ve been working late some nights to keep up with deadlines, but then I feel guilty for not spending enough time with my partner or taking breaks. I’ve been trying to set boundaries, but it’s a work in progress.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: Setting boundaries is key, especially during stressful periods. Have you tried any specific strategies—like designated "off" times or tech-free zones—to help create that balance?  
Zoë: Yes, I’ve started turning off work notifications after 7 pm and trying to dedicate weekends to rest and connecting with my partner. It’s helping, but I still catch myself checking emails sometimes.  

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a positive step. Building new habits takes time. How do you feel about incorporating more self-care routines, perhaps more physical activity or creative outlets, to support your emotional resilience?  
Zoë: I’d love to do more yoga or journaling, but I haven’t prioritized it yet. I think I need to schedule it more intentionally. Maybe even a weekly walk or some time in nature.  

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Those sound like excellent ideas. Even brief moments of mindfulness in nature can be restorative. As we reflect on the progress over the past months, what do you feel has been your biggest growth?  
Zoë: I think I’ve become better at recognizing and naming my emotions, rather than just feeling overwhelmed. Also, I’ve started sharing more openly with my partner, which has made us feel closer.  

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful progress, Zoë. It shows your resilience and willingness to grow. Looking ahead, what would you like to focus on in our upcoming sessions?  
Zoë: I’d like to work more on managing work stress without feeling guilty, and continue strengthening our communication. Also, I want to explore ways to stay emotionally balanced through the fertility journey.  

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: Those are meaningful goals. We can develop practical tools for stress management and communication exercises to support you. For next time, perhaps you could try a brief daily gratitude or self-compassion practice—just five minutes—to nurture yourself.  
Zoë: That sounds good. I’ll give it a try. Thanks, Serena. I feel a bit more hopeful today.  
Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is often gradual, and you’re doing incredibly well. I’ll see you next week with some tailored exercises to support your goals.
