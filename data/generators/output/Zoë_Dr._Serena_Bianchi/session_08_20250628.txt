Date: June 28, 2025
Time: 11:00 AM
Client: Zoë (UX Researcher)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It’s good to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
(soft smile, attentive posture)  

[11:02] Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed this week—kind of caught between work stress and everything else.  
(sighs softly)  

[11:04] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a lot to carry. Last week, you mentioned how your fertility treatments have been adding to your stress, and your work has been pretty demanding lately. How are you managing those feelings right now?  

[11:06] Zoë: I’ve been trying to keep up with my meditation and journaling, like we talked about last time, but honestly, it’s hard to switch off my mind. Sometimes I just feel anxious, like I’m not doing enough or I’m falling behind both at work and personally.  

[11:08] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. It sounds like your mind is quite active, especially with everything going on. Have you noticed any particular triggers that increase your anxiety?  

[11:10] Zoë: Yeah, I think it’s when I see messages from my doctor about my fertility progress, or when I get last-minute deadlines at work. Sometimes, I catch myself ruminating about whether I’m doing enough or if I’m handling everything well.  

[11:12] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common experience when juggling multiple stressors. Let’s try to explore those feelings a bit more. When you notice yourself ruminating, what emotions are coming up?  

[11:15] Zoë: Mostly fear, I guess—fear that I won’t be able to have a child, or that I’m not giving my relationship enough attention. I also feel guilt sometimes, like I should be stronger or more organized.  

(voice softens)  
And I feel sad, too. Like I’m losing a bit of myself in all this.  

[11:17] Dr. Bianchi: Those are very deep and valid feelings. It’s understandable to feel fear and sadness during such an intense period. Have you been able to share these feelings with your partner?  

[11:20] Zoë: A little, but I tend to hold back because I don’t want to worry him more. Plus, sometimes I feel like he’s dealing with his own frustrations and doesn’t need to hear mine.  

[11:22] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to hold back, especially when we want to protect our loved ones. But sharing your feelings can help both of you feel more connected and supported. Would you like to explore ways to communicate these emotions more openly?  

[11:25] Zoë: Yeah, I think that would help. Sometimes I start to shut down or become distant, and I know that’s not good for us.  

[11:27] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a meaningful insight. In our previous sessions, we worked on emotion tracking and sharing feelings using specific language. Have you noticed any differences when you practice those techniques?  

[11:30] Zoë: I’ve gotten better at recognizing my emotions, especially when I journal or use my app. But actually expressing them verbally is still tricky—sometimes I just freeze or change the subject.  

[11:33] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a normal challenge. Building that capacity takes time. Would you like to try a brief exercise now—perhaps naming and sharing one emotion you’re experiencing in this moment?  

[11:35] Zoë: Sure. I’d say I feel anxious, and also a bit hopeful—hopeful that I can get through this and find some clarity.  

(leans forward slightly)  
It’s like I want to trust that things will work out, but I’m scared to fully believe that yet.  

[11:38] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very honest reflection. Hope and fear often coexist during difficult times. Recognizing both can help you process your feelings more fully. Let’s try a quick exercise: I’ll prompt you to describe a recent situation where you felt this mix of emotions, and we can work through it together.  

[11:40] Zoë: Okay. Um, yesterday I had a meeting with my team, and I was feeling anxious because I had to present some new research findings. But I also felt hopeful because I knew I had prepared well.  

[11:43] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great example. When you think about that moment, what was going on internally?  

[11:45] Zoë: I was nervous, like my stomach was tight, but I also felt proud of the work I did. It was a bit like a rollercoaster—fear and pride at the same time.  

[11:48] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a vivid picture. Recognizing these mixed emotions can help you understand yourself better. How did you handle that situation?  

[11:50] Zoë: I took a deep breath before starting, tried to focus on the facts rather than my worries. I also reminded myself that I’ve prepared thoroughly.  

[11:52] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Those are grounding techniques—using breath and self-affirmation—that can be very helpful. How do you feel about trying to incorporate a brief mindfulness or grounding exercise when you notice these intense feelings?  

[11:55] Zoë: I think I could do that. Sometimes I forget to pause, but I see how it could help me stay centered.  

[11:57] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good step. Remember, it’s about small, consistent practices. Now, considering your relationship, how are things between you and your partner?  

[12:00] Zoë: Overall, I think we’re doing okay, but I know I’ve been distant lately, and I feel guilty about that. Sometimes I don’t have the energy to talk or connect after a full day.  

[12:03] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable, especially with everything you’re managing. Has this distance affected your feelings about your relationship?  

[12:05] Zoë: A little. I worry that if I don’t open up more, we might grow apart. But I also feel overwhelmed trying to keep everything balanced.  

[12:08] Dr. Bianchi: It’s a delicate balance. In our work together, we’ve talked about small ways to foster connection even during busy times—like sharing a moment of gratitude or a quick check-in. Would you like to set a goal for this week to practice that?  

[12:10] Zoë: Yes, I think I can do that. Maybe at dinner, I can share one thing I appreciated about him that day.  

(soft smile)  
That might help us reconnect even a little.  

[12:12] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a lovely idea. Small gestures can have a big impact. As we move forward, we’ll continue building on these strategies—balancing emotional awareness with practical steps. Before we finish today, are there any specific concerns or questions you’d like to address?  

[12:15] Zoë: I guess I just want to keep moving forward, even when things feel heavy. I’m hopeful I can find ways to manage the stress better and stay connected with my partner.  

[12:17] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a strong and hopeful outlook. Remember, progress is often about small, consistent efforts. And I’m here to support you through that. For next week, perhaps we can focus on refining communication exercises and exploring self-care routines tailored to your needs.  

[12:20] Zoë: Sounds good. Thanks, Serena. I really appreciate your guidance.  

[12:22] Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome, Zoë. I look forward to seeing how you continue to grow and find balance. Take care until then.
