**[11:00]**  
Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Zoë. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Zoë: Hi, Serena. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. Still feeling pretty overwhelmed with everything — the fertility stuff, work, and trying to keep things steady with Alex.  

Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a lot to juggle. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been most prominent for you this week?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think it’s the stress around fertility. I’ve been tracking my cycle, and I notice I get really anxious around ovulation time. It’s like this mental countdown that I can’t turn off.  

Dr. Bianchi: I hear you. That constant anticipation can be exhausting. Have you noticed any specific feelings or thoughts that come up during those times?  

Zoë: Mostly fear — like, what if it doesn’t happen? Or guilt, because I feel like I should be more hopeful but I’m just tired of disappointment. Sometimes I feel pretty hopeless, honestly.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. It’s really painful to hold that hope, especially when past cycles haven’t gone as planned. Do you notice how these feelings affect your relationship with Alex?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think it’s been tough. I sometimes shut down, or I get snappy. I don’t mean to, but I’m just so overwhelmed that I can’t always communicate well. I worry I’m pushing him away.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very common reaction under stress — feeling overwhelmed can make it hard to stay connected emotionally. Have you and Alex talked openly about how each of you is feeling about this journey?  

Zoë: Not as much as we should. We do talk, but mostly about logistics — appointments, meds, timelines. We haven’t really sat down and just shared how each of us is feeling deep down.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s an important insight. Sharing those inner experiences can help strengthen your emotional bond and reduce feelings of isolation. Would you like us to explore some ways to facilitate that kind of communication today?  

Zoë: Yeah, I think that would help. I want us to feel closer, not more distant.  

[11:10]  
Dr. Bianchi: Great. Before we get into exercises, I’d like to check in on your emotional tracking from last week. How did it go? Did you find the tools helpful?  

Zoë: I did. I kept a journal, and I used my app to log my feelings. I noticed that during the most stressful days, I tend to feel a mix of frustration and sadness, but I also see moments of hope when I talk to friends or do meditation.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a valuable observation — noticing those fluctuations. It indicates you have a resilient core, even amidst the stress. How do you usually respond when these intense feelings arise?  

Zoë: Honestly, I tend to suppress them a lot during work. I try to push through, but then I get home and it all hits me at once. That’s when I get really tearful or irritable.  

Dr. Bianchi: Suppressing feelings can sometimes lead to a buildup, making emotional regulation harder over time. Have you tried any specific self-care strategies when you notice these feelings intensifying?  

Zoë: I’ve started doing breathing exercises and a bit of journaling. Sometimes I listen to calming music or take short walks. But I still find it hard to slow down when I’m stressed at work.  

Dr. Bianchi: Those are excellent tools. Building in moments of mindfulness can create that pause you need. Would you be open to trying a brief emotion-focused exercise now, to help you connect with what you’re feeling in this moment?  

Zoë: Sure, I’d like that.  

[11:20]  
Dr. Bianchi: Great. I’d like you to close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. As you do, bring awareness to your body — where do you feel tension or discomfort?  

(Zoë closes her eyes, takes deep breaths)  

Dr. Bianchi: What are you noticing?  

Zoë: My shoulders are tight, and my stomach feels a bit clenched. I think I’m still holding on to some anxiety about today’s session.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s very insightful. Now, I want you to try to identify what emotion is most present right now. Is it fear, sadness, frustration, or something else?  

Zoë: I think it’s a mix, but mostly anxiety — about opening up, about whether I’m doing enough to handle everything.  

Dr. Bianchi: Acknowledging that anxiety is a strong step. Can you tell me what you might need right now to feel more safe and supported?  

Zoë: Maybe just to be heard, and to know that it’s okay to feel anxious. Sometimes I think I should just be stronger, but I guess I don’t have to carry it all alone.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very healthy realization, Zoë. Remember, feeling anxious doesn’t mean you’re weak — it’s a natural response to stress. Sharing that openly is a sign of strength.  

[11:30]  
Dr. Bianchi: Let’s shift a bit to your relationship with Alex. You mentioned earlier that you sometimes shut down or get snappy. Would you like to practice a communication exercise that can help you express your feelings more effectively?  

Zoë: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I want us to connect better, especially now.  

Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. I’ll guide you through a simple "I feel" statement. Think about a recent time when you felt overwhelmed or distant from him. Can you recall an instance?  

Zoë: Last night, I think. We were talking about my fertility appointment, and I felt myself getting defensive when he asked if I was hopeful enough.  

Dr. Bianchi: All right. Now, try to say aloud what you felt in that moment, starting with “I feel…”  

Zoë: I feel frustrated and misunderstood when you ask if I’m hopeful enough.  

Dr. Bianchi: Very good. Now, add what you need from him to feel more supported.  

Zoë: I need you to listen without trying to fix it or tell me to stay positive. Just hear me out.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a clear and compassionate message. Would you like to practice saying that to him later, or perhaps write it down to share?  

Zoë: I’d like to try saying it to him. I think it would help us understand each other better.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a brave step. Remember, expressing your feelings honestly can deepen your connection. Do you feel more confident about approaching this?  

Zoë: Yeah, I do. It’s a little scary, but I think it’s necessary.  

[11:40]  
Dr. Bianchi: Wonderful. Before we wrap up, I’d like us to briefly discuss your work-life balance. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed, especially during treatment. Have you been able to set any boundaries or carve out time for self-care?  

Zoë: I’ve tried to schedule some downtime, like evening walks or meditation. But work often bleeds into my evenings, especially with tight deadlines. I feel guilty stepping away sometimes.  

Dr. Bianchi: That guilt is common, but remember, setting boundaries is vital for your well-being. It’s okay to prioritize your health during this time. Would you consider creating a small ritual or routine at the end of your workday to signal a shift?  

Zoë: Maybe turning off my work notifications and doing a quick meditation or stretching. I think that could help me disconnect.  

Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a great idea. Making space between work and personal life can help reduce stress and improve your mood. How about we set a goal for you to implement this routine over the next week?  

Zoë: I’d like that. I think it might help me feel a bit more in control.  

Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. And as we conclude, I want to acknowledge the effort you’re making — tracking your feelings, communicating with Alex, and working on boundaries. It’s all part of building resilience.  

Zoë: Thank you, Serena. I feel like I’m learning a lot about myself and how to handle everything.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful to hear. Next time, we can explore more about your support network and how to strengthen it. For now, I’ll give you some journaling prompts and a mindfulness exercise to practice during the week.  

Zoë: Sounds good. Thanks so much.  

Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome. Take care until our next session.  

Zoë: You too. (smiles)
