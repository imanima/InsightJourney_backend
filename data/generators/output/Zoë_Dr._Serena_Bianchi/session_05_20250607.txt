[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Hi Zoë, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Any particular moments or feelings you'd like to start with today?

[11:02] Zoë: Hi Serena. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed this week. The fertility treatments are taking a toll, and I’ve been trying to keep up with work, but it’s hard to switch off. Some days feel heavier than others.

[11:04] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That sounds really tough—balancing the emotional weight of fertility treatments with work demands. When you say “heavier,” what specific feelings or thoughts come up for you during those times?

[11:06] Zoë: I mostly feel anxious and a bit hopeless at times. Like, I’m doing everything I can, but it still feels out of control. Sometimes I notice I’m withdrawing from my partner because I don’t want to burden him with my worries.

[11:08] Dr. Serena Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel anxious and hopeless with such uncertainty. You mentioned withdrawing from your partner—how has that been affecting your connection with him?

[11:10] Zoë: I think it’s created some distance. He’s been supportive, but I can tell he’s worried too, and I don’t want him to feel shut out. I guess I’m afraid that if I open up more, I’ll just seem vulnerable or needy.

[11:12] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a very common concern, Zoë—wanting to protect your partner from feeling overwhelmed, while also needing support yourself. Let’s explore how you might express your feelings in a way that feels safe for both of you. Would you be comfortable trying a brief exercise with me now?

[11:14] Zoë: Sure, I’m willing to try.

[11:16] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Great. I’d like you to think about a recent moment when you felt particularly overwhelmed or anxious. Take a moment to recall it vividly. When you’re ready, can you describe what you experienced emotionally and physically at that time?

[11:18] Zoë: (pauses, takes a deep breath) Okay. I remember feeling this tight knot in my chest, like I couldn’t breathe properly. Emotionally, I felt this mix of fear and frustration—like I was stuck in this cycle and couldn’t get out.

[11:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Thank you for sharing that. That physical sensation of a tight knot and that mix of fear and frustration—let’s label that as part of your emotional experience. How might you communicate this feeling to your partner in a way that invites understanding rather than worry?

[11:22] Zoë: Maybe I could say, “I’m feeling really anxious and physically tense right now, and I need some support or just someone to listen.” I think that’s honest but not overwhelming.

[11:24] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a very clear and honest way to express your needs. It allows your partner to understand what you’re experiencing without feeling blamed or helpless. How does that feel to you—knowing you can share that?

[11:26] Zoë: It feels a bit relieving, actually. Like I can be vulnerable without feeling like I’m burdening him or losing control.

[11:28] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Excellent. Vulnerability can be a strength in strengthening your connection. Now, let’s briefly revisit how your work with the fertility tracking apps and digital journaling has been supporting your emotional processing. Have you noticed any patterns or insights lately?

[11:30] Zoë: Yes. The journaling helps me get my feelings out, especially when I feel overwhelmed. I also track my moods and symptoms, which sometimes makes me feel more in control—like I’m gathering data to understand my body better.

[11:32] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a powerful way to regain a sense of agency. How do you feel about sharing some of those journal entries with your partner, or perhaps discussing your mood patterns with him?

[11:34] Zoë: I’ve thought about it. I think sharing some parts could help him understand what I’m going through. But I worry it might be too much information or make him anxious.

[11:36] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a valid concern. Perhaps starting with a simple, shared reflection—like how you’re feeling today—could be a gentle way to open that door. Would you feel comfortable trying that before our next session?

[11:38] Zoë: Yes, I think I can do that. It might help us stay connected and support each other better.

[11:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Wonderful. Let’s also check in on your self-care strategies. Last time, we talked about integrating some stress-relief practices during your day. Have you been able to incorporate meditation or brief grounding exercises?

[11:42] Zoë: I’ve tried a few times, especially in the mornings. It helps me start the day with a bit more calm, but I sometimes forget during busy work hours. Still a work in progress.

[11:44] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s perfectly normal. Building new habits takes time. Perhaps setting reminders or short breathing breaks during your day could reinforce that practice. How does that sound?

[11:46] Zoë: That sounds doable. I’ll try to set a reminder on my phone for midday.

[11:48] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Good plan. Now, reflecting on our sessions so far, how do you feel your emotional resilience is developing? Any shifts or insights?

[11:50] Zoë: I think I’m getting better at recognizing my feelings and expressing them. The emotion labeling exercise was helpful. I still get overwhelmed, but I feel more equipped to handle it now.

[11:52] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a significant step. Remember, resilience isn’t about eliminating stress but managing it with awareness and support. As we approach the end of our session, what’s one goal you’d like to focus on before we meet next week?

[11:54] Zoë: I want to practice sharing my feelings more openly with my partner, even if it’s just small things. Also, I’ll work on setting those midday reminders for my self-care.

[11:56] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Those are excellent goals. I’ll look forward to hearing how that goes. For next time, maybe we can also explore some additional strategies for balancing work and personal needs during this challenging time. How does that sound?

[11:58] Zoë: That sounds helpful. Thank you, Serena. I feel like I’m making progress, even if it’s gradual.

[12:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that, Zoë. Remember, progress is often in small steps. You’re doing wonderfully. Let’s conclude here for today. I’ll see you next week, and in the meantime, keep practicing those sharing and self-care strategies. Take good care.

[12:02] Zoë: Thank you. See you next week.
