Time: 10:00 AM
Client: Evan (Senior DevOps Engineer)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[10:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Evan nods slightly, appears a bit tired but engaged)  

[10:05] Evan: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been stressful, and caring for my dad is taking a toll. But I’m trying to stay focused.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a lot to handle. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with those responsibilities. Last time, we talked about your work-life balance and setting some boundaries. How has that been going?  

[10:12] Evan: I’ve tried to be more intentional about disconnecting after work. I’ve started turning off notifications and not checking emails late at night. It helps a bit, but I still feel anxious about missing something.  

[10:15] Dr. Bianchi: It’s great that you’re taking those steps. That anxiety about missing things is common, especially with your role in DevOps. When you notice that anxiety creeping in, what do you usually do?  

[10:20] Evan: I guess I try to distract myself or just push through, but sometimes it just makes me more restless. I haven't really found a way to sit with that feeling yet.  

[10:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good observation. Sometimes, allowing ourselves to acknowledge the anxiety can lessen its grip. Would you be open to exploring how you might do that? Maybe by naming or tracking that feeling when it arises?  

( Evan nods, appearing thoughtful)  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: Let’s also revisit the support system you mentioned before. Have you connected with friends or colleagues about the stress you’re experiencing?  

[10:32] Evan: Not really. I don’t want to burden anyone, and honestly, I think I’m worried about seeming weak. I keep it to myself most of the time.  

[10:35] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to feel that way, but sharing your feelings can actually strengthen your support network. Sometimes, people want to help, but they don’t know what you need unless you tell them. Would you consider reaching out to someone, maybe a close friend or a colleague you trust?  

[10:38] Evan: Maybe. I have a friend from work who’s been through similar stuff, but I haven't talked to him about this level of stress.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: That could be a good start. Opening up more might also help you feel less isolated. How about we also look at creating a small support plan? Who else in your life could be part of that, even in small ways?  

( Evan considers, then nods slowly)  

[10:45] Evan: I think my wife, Lisa, is aware I’m stressed, but I haven’t really asked her for specific support. I guess I could do that more intentionally.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a wonderful idea. Communicating your needs clearly can help her understand how best to support you. Let’s also touch on self-care—what’s something you enjoy that helps you relax?  

[10:55] Evan: I like listening to music or taking short walks when I get a chance. But lately, even those feel like just more things I’m squeezing in.  

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like your self-care routines are helpful but perhaps not enough right now. Sometimes, intentionally scheduling meaningful self-care, even in small doses, can make a difference. Would you be willing to try setting aside a dedicated time for a walk or listening to music without feeling guilty?  

( Evan nods, more engaged)  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: Great. As we move forward, we can work on building a personalized self-care plan and support system that feels sustainable. Also, I’d like us to check in on your emotional tracking—how comfortable are you with naming and expressing your feelings about caregiving and work?  

[11:10] Evan: Honestly, I tend to suppress a lot of it. I don’t want to seem weak or overwhelmed in front of my family or colleagues.  

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common experience. But recognizing and expressing your feelings can help you process them better and reduce stress. Maybe we can practice some emotion labeling exercises in our next session. How does that sound?  

( Evan smiles faintly)  

[11:20] Evan: Yeah, I think that could help. I want to get better at handling all these feelings without feeling so exhausted all the time.  

[11:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very healthy goal. As a next step, I’ll send you some simple emotion-tracking tools, and we can review how they work in our next session. Also, let’s plan to revisit your support network and self-care strategies. Does that sound good?  

[11:30] Evan: Yes, I appreciate that. It feels good to have some concrete steps.  

[11:35] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Before we wrap up today, how are you feeling now compared to when you first walked in?  

(Evan pauses, then responds thoughtfully)  

[11:40] Evan: I think I feel a little more hopeful. Talking it out helps, and having a plan makes it all seem a bit more manageable.  

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress isn’t always linear, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. We’ll continue working together to strengthen your coping skills and support system.  

[11:50] Evan: Thanks, Serena. I feel more grounded already. Looking forward to next time.  

[11:55] Dr. Bianchi: Me too, Evan. Take care until then.  

(They exchange a warm smile as the session concludes)
