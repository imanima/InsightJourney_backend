[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Evan shifts in his chair, takes a deep breath)  

[10:05] Evan: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The stress from caring for my dad has been pretty intense lately, but I’ve also started to notice some small improvements in how I handle it.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s good to hear that you’re noticing some improvements. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening with your dad?  

[10:15] Evan: Yeah, he’s been more confused than usual, which means more frequent calls from the nursing home. It’s hard not to feel overwhelmed when I get those calls after work. Sometimes I feel guilty for not being there more, but I also have work deadlines I need to meet.  

[10:20] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like you’re balancing a lot right now—your caregiving responsibilities and work pressures. When those calls come in, what kind of feelings or physical responses do you notice?  

[10:25] Evan: I usually feel a rush of anxiety—like my chest tightens, and I get a bit jittery. It’s like I’m on high alert, even when I’m just trying to focus on my tasks. I know it’s stress, but I can’t seem to turn it off sometimes.  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s very understandable, Evan. Your body’s response is telling you that you’re under significant stress. Last time, we talked about developing a support system. How has that been going?  

[10:35] Evan: I’ve reached out to a couple of friends and some colleagues at work. They’ve been supportive, but I don’t want to burden them too much. I also started a support group online for caregivers, which helps to share experiences.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s excellent—you’re building a network, which is crucial. How do you feel when you connect with others in that group?  

[10:45] Evan: It’s comforting. Hearing others’ stories makes me feel less alone, and I realize some of what I’m feeling is normal. It also gives me ideas for managing my stress better.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a powerful insight. Recognizing that others experience similar feelings can reduce the isolation. Have you been able to incorporate any self-care routines into your schedule?  

[10:55] Evan: I’ve tried to. I’ve started going for short walks during lunch, and I’ve been listening to music more. But honestly, I struggle to find time, especially with my workload.  

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to struggle with finding time. Let’s explore some ways to make small, sustainable self-care practices part of your routine. For example, even five-minute breathing exercises or brief moments of mindfulness during your day. Would you be open to trying that?  

[11:05] Evan: Yeah, I think I could do that. Even just a few minutes of breathing exercises could help me reset.  

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Now, regarding boundaries—have you been able to set limits around work or caregiving calls?  

[11:15] Evan: I’ve tried to, but it’s tough. Sometimes I feel guilty turning off my phone or saying no to extra work tasks. I worry about letting people down.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: Guilt can be a heavy weight. Remember, setting boundaries is essential for your well-being and ultimately helps you be more present for your dad and at work. Small, clear boundaries can be effective—like designated times when you check in on caregiving updates or specific work hours. Would you like to develop some specific boundary-setting strategies today?  

[11:25] Evan: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to feel more in control and less guilty about protecting my time.  

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: Perfect. Let’s also revisit your feelings from earlier—when you mentioned the anxiety and physical tension. We can incorporate some emotion tracking to help you identify and process these feelings in real-time. Over the next week, I’d like you to note when you feel this tension and what triggers it. How does that sound?  

[11:35] Evan: That sounds doable. I think just being more aware of my feelings can help me manage them better.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: Exactly. Awareness is the first step toward change. Before our next session, I’d also like you to try scheduling one small self-care activity each day and practice setting at least one boundary around your work or caregiving. How does that feel?  

[11:45] Evan: It feels manageable. I appreciate having concrete steps to work on.  

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Wonderful. To wrap up today, I want to acknowledge how much you’re managing—caring for your father, balancing work, and seeking ways to support yourself. That’s a lot of responsibility, and I see your effort. Next time, we can review how the emotion tracking and boundary setting went, and explore any new challenges or successes.  

[11:55] Evan: Thanks, Serena. I really appreciate your support. I feel hopeful I can make some progress.  

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: Me too, Evan. Take care of yourself this week, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next session.
