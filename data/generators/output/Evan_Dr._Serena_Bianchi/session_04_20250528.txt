**[10:00] Dr. Bianchi:** Good morning, Evan. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
**[10:02] Evan:** Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and caring for my dad is still a full-time job outside of that. I feel pretty drained.  

**[10:05] Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds overwhelming. It’s understandable to feel drained with so much on your plate. Last time, we talked about identifying your stress triggers and building a support network. How has that been going?  

**[10:07] Evan:** Well, I’ve made some progress. I reached out to a couple of friends and my sister to check in more regularly. But I still struggle with feeling like I’m burdening them or that I should be handling everything myself.  

**[10:10] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a common feeling for caregivers — wanting to manage everything independently. Let’s explore that a bit. When you think about reaching out, what thoughts come up?  

**[10:12] Evan:** I guess I worry they’ll think I’m weak or that I can’t handle it. And sometimes, I feel guilty asking for help when Dad’s health isn’t improving.  

**[10:15] Dr. Bianchi:** Those feelings of guilt and fear of judgment are really tough. It’s good you’re aware of them. Can you recall what we discussed last week about reframing these thoughts?  

**[10:17] Evan:** Yeah, I remember. You suggested that asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness, but of strength, because it shows I recognize my limits. I’ve tried to keep that in mind, but it’s still hard to fully believe it.  

**[10:20] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a significant insight, Evan. Beliefs don’t shift overnight. It’s a process. Have you noticed any moments where you were able to ask for support and felt better afterward?  

**[10:23] Evan:** Actually, yes. Last week, I reached out to my sister about arranging some respite care. She was relieved and said she’d help coordinate. It felt good to delegate, even if just a little.  

**[10:25] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a wonderful step. Recognizing those small wins can reinforce your confidence. Let’s also talk about how your work stress interacts with caregiving. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times. Can you tell me about a recent example?  

**[10:28] Evan:** Sure. Last Thursday, I was on a critical deployment at work, and I got an emergency call from my mom about Dad’s condition. I had to step away from my screen and handle the situation. It was a lot to juggle.  

**[10:30] Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds incredibly stressful — managing high-stakes work while dealing with a family emergency. How did you cope in that moment?  

**[10:33] Evan:** I took a few deep breaths, tried to stay calm, and then quickly delegated some of my tasks to a teammate. But afterward, I felt exhausted and guilty for not being fully present at work or with Dad.  

**[10:35] Dr. Bianchi:** Those feelings of guilt are common, especially when balancing roles. It’s important to recognize that doing your best in each domain is enough. Let’s explore some ways to create boundaries so you can better manage these overlaps.  

**[10:38] Evan:** That would be helpful. I often feel like I have to be available 24/7, especially during on-call shifts. It’s hard to switch off.  

**[10:40] Dr. Bianchi:** Setting boundaries around work hours and caregiving time is crucial. Have you considered specific strategies, like designated "work-free" times or using an out-of-office message when you need to focus on Dad?  

**[10:43] Evan:** I haven’t formalized that yet, but I think I could start scheduling specific times when I disconnect from work. Maybe communicate that to my team.  

**[10:45] Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds like a solid plan. Communicating your boundaries can also reduce feelings of guilt, knowing others respect your time. Now, let’s shift a bit. How have you been caring for yourself amidst all this?  

**[10:48] Evan:** Honestly, I haven’t been great at that. I catch myself skipping meals or not sleeping well. I know I need to do better, but it’s hard to prioritize myself.  

**[10:50] Dr. Bianchi:** Self-care is often the first thing to go when we’re overwhelmed. What small self-care activity could you commit to this week?  

**[10:52] Evan:** Maybe I can start with 10 minutes of stretching in the morning or a quick walk during lunch. It’s not much, but I think it might help.  

**[10:55] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a great start. Even brief moments of self-care can build resilience over time. Let’s also think about your emotional support. Who in your support system do you feel most comfortable sharing your feelings with?  

**[10:57] Evan:** Probably my wife, but she’s also busy with her work and our kids. Sometimes, I hesitate to burden her with my stress.  

**[10:59] Dr. Bianchi:** It’s understandable to hesitate, but sharing your feelings can strengthen your connection and reduce your burden. Perhaps setting aside a specific time to talk openly with her could help.  

**[11:00] Dr. Bianchi:** We’re approaching the end of our session. For next time, I’d like you to try reaching out to one person in your support network and schedule that self-care activity. We’ll also review how boundary setting is going. How does that sound?  

**[11:03] Evan:** That sounds good. I’ll give it a try. Thanks, Serena. It helps to have these concrete steps.  

**[11:05] Dr. Bianchi:** You’re doing really well, Evan. Remember, these small steps add up. We’ll continue building on this progress next week. Take care until then.  

**[11:07] Evan:** Thanks. See you next week.
