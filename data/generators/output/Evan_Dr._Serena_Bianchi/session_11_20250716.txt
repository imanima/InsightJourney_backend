Client: Evan (Senior DevOps Engineer)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:03] Evan: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been stressful, and caring for my dad with dementia is taking a toll. I feel a mix of exhaustion and guilt sometimes.

[10:05] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with those responsibilities. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been particularly intense for you lately?

[10:07] Evan: Well, this past week, I had a few late-night calls about system outages at work, which meant I didn’t get enough sleep. Then, during the day, I’d get calls from my mom about my dad’s latest confusion episodes. It’s like I’m juggling two crises at once.

[10:09] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a lot to handle. It seems like your workload and caregiving are overlapping in a way that’s really taxing. How are you managing your stress during these times?

[10:11] Evan: Honestly, I try to push through, but I notice I’m more irritable, and I snap at my partner sometimes without meaning to. I don’t want to take this out on her, but I can’t seem to help it.

[10:13] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very honest awareness. Recognizing how stress affects your interactions is a good first step. Have you noticed any specific triggers that lead to those moments of irritability?

[10:15] Evan: Usually, when I’m exhausted and I get another urgent call about the system or my dad, I just feel overwhelmed and short-tempered.

[10:17] Dr. Bianchi: It makes sense that fatigue and constant pressure are wearing on you. Let’s explore some ways to identify and manage these stress triggers more effectively. Have you been able to implement any self-care routines since our last discussion?

[10:20] Evan: I’ve tried, but honestly, with my schedule, I end up skipping meals or just collapsing in front of the TV. I haven’t been consistent with anything.

[10:22] Dr. Bianchi: Consistency can be tough when everything feels urgent. Maybe we can work on small, manageable steps for self-care that fit into your day. For example, brief breathing exercises or a 5-minute mindfulness moment between tasks. Would that be helpful?

[10:25] Evan: Yeah, that sounds doable. I think I need some quick ways to reset, especially during work.

[10:27] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s also look at your support system. Last time, you mentioned feeling somewhat isolated. Have you connected with any friends, family, or support groups recently?

[10:30] Evan: I haven’t reached out much. My sister lives nearby, but she’s busy with her kids, and I don’t want to burden her. My partner is supportive, but she’s also dealing with her own stress about her career.

[10:33] Dr. Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel hesitant about leaning on others, but sharing your feelings can be very relieving. Sometimes, just telling someone what you’re going through can lighten the emotional load. Would you feel comfortable mapping out your current support network today?

[10:35] Evan: Yeah, I think that would help. I don’t have a clear picture of who I can rely on besides my partner and maybe my sister.

[10:37] Dr. Bianchi: Let’s do that now. (She pulls up a shared digital support map.) So, we have your partner, your sister—anyone else come to mind?

[10:40] Evan: Hmm, maybe my close friend from college. We catch up now and then, but I haven’t really asked for support.

[10:42] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start. Sometimes, just reaching out with a specific request—like needing someone to talk to or help with errands—can make a difference. How comfortable do you feel about doing that?

[10:45] Evan: Honestly, a bit nervous. I don’t want to seem like I’m complaining or burdening people.

[10:47] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common concern. Remember, those who care about you often want to support you, especially when you’re honest about your needs. Would you like to practice phrasing a message you could send to your friend later?

[10:50] Evan: Yeah, that would be helpful.

[10:52] Dr. Bianchi: Great. You might say, “Hey, I’ve been going through a tough patch with work and caring for my dad, and I’d really appreciate someone to talk to. Are you available sometime this week?”

[10:55] Evan: Okay, that sounds natural. I’ll try that.

[10:57] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. Now, considering your workload and caregiving stress, what are some boundaries you might set to protect your energy?

[11:00] Evan: I guess I could try to limit after-hours work emails and set specific times when I focus solely on my dad or myself.

[11:02] Dr. Bianchi: Yes, boundaries are vital. Even small actions, like turning off notifications after a certain hour, can help create space for rest. How do you feel about committing to one boundary this week?

[11:05] Evan: I think I can try turning off work emails after 7 PM. That might help me disconnect.

[11:07] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a strong step. Let’s also revisit your self-care plan. What’s one activity you’d like to incorporate regularly?

[11:10] Evan: I’d like to try a short walk outside during lunch. It’s a simple way to clear my head.

[11:12] Dr. Bianchi: Perfect. Even five minutes can make a difference. How about scheduling that walk into your calendar as an appointment with yourself?

[11:15] Evan: Yeah, I can do that. I’ll set a reminder.

[11:17] Dr. Bianchi: Great. To summarize today, we identified your stress triggers, mapped your support network, discussed boundary-setting, and planned a self-care activity. How are you feeling about these steps?

[11:20] Evan: Honestly, a bit more hopeful. It’s good to have concrete actions instead of just feeling overwhelmed.

[11:22] Dr. Bianchi: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, progress is gradual, and it’s okay to have setbacks. We’ll check in on these next week. Any questions before we finish?

[11:25] Evan: No, I think I’m good for now. Thanks, Serena.

[11:27] Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome. I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Let’s keep building on this foundation. See you next week.
