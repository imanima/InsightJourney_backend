Session 3/24
Date: May 21, 2025
Time: 10:00 AM
Client: Evan (Senior DevOps Engineer)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Evan shifts slightly, takes a breath)  
Evan: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been pretty intense, and I’m still trying to juggle everything at home with my dad.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. Last time, we started exploring some ways to manage your stress and support your caregiving role. Have you noticed any changes or new challenges since then?  
(Evan nods, looks down briefly)  
Evan: I’ve been trying to set some boundaries with work, like turning off notifications after hours, but it’s hard. My on-call shifts still spill over, and I worry about missing something with Dad.  

[10:15] Dr. Bianchi: It’s understandable that those boundaries feel difficult to maintain, especially with the unpredictability of his needs. How do you feel about the support system around you? Have you reached out to anyone recently?  
Evan: I’ve talked a bit more with my sister. She’s been helping out more, especially with some medical appointments. But I still feel like I’m carrying a lot on my own.  

[10:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a significant insight—that you’re feeling somewhat isolated even with some support. It’s good that your sister is involved; perhaps we can think about strengthening your support network further. What about friends or community resources?  
(Evan hesitates slightly)  
Evan: I haven’t really reached out beyond family. I guess I don’t want to bother anyone, and I worry about seeming overwhelmed.  

[10:25] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common feeling—wanting to handle things alone, especially when you’re used to being responsible and organized. But sharing your feelings can actually lessen your burden. Maybe we can explore ways to communicate your needs more comfortably.  
(Evan nods slowly)  
Evan: Yeah, I think that could help. I just don’t always know what to ask for or how to say it.  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great point. Sometimes, framing what you need in small, specific ways makes it easier to ask. For example, “Could you check in on Dad while I take a short break?” or “Would you mind helping me with some errands this week?” Does that resonate?  
Evan: Yeah, that sounds doable. I tend to think I have to do everything myself, so asking for help feels a bit uncomfortable.  

[10:35] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very common experience. Part of our work is to normalize asking for support and to develop strategies that feel manageable for you. Let’s also revisit your self-care routines. How have you been taking care of yourself lately?  
(Evan looks away briefly, then sighs)  
Evan: Honestly, I’ve been neglecting myself. Between work deadlines and Dad’s care, I forget to eat properly or even get some sleep.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a crucial point—your well-being is vital, especially in this caregiving role. Have you thought about scheduling some small self-care practices? Even brief breaks, stretching, or a moment of mindfulness?  
Evan: I’ve heard about mindfulness, but I haven’t really tried it. I think I could do short breathing exercises, maybe in the car or during lunch.  

[10:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start. Even a few deep breaths can help reduce immediate stress. Also, setting aside a regular time for activities you enjoy—like a walk or listening to music—can make a difference. Would you be willing to try scheduling a brief self-care ritual this week?  
(Evan nods)  
Evan: Yeah, I can do that. I think I need to be more intentional about it.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. As we move forward, we’ll also look at creating a more detailed support plan and exploring how you can communicate your needs effectively. Before our next session, perhaps you can try reaching out to one support person and practice asking for what you need. How does that sound?  
Evan: That sounds good. I’ll give it a shot.  

[10:55] Dr. Bianchi: Great. And remember, progress is about small steps. We’re building a sustainable approach together. For next time, let’s check in on how these conversations go and any new feelings or challenges that arise.  
(Evan offers a tentative smile)  
Evan: Thanks, Serena. I appreciate the support.  

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: You're very welcome, Evan. Take care until then, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session.
