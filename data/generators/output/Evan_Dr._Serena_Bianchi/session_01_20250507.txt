Time: 10:00 AM
Client: Evan (Senior DevOps Engineer)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

**10:00**  
Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Evan: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Um, honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been busy, and with my dad’s condition, I’ve felt pretty overwhelmed at times.  

**10:10**  
Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a lot to juggle. You mentioned last time you were trying to find ways to manage your stress and support your family better. Have there been any moments this week where you felt more in control or, conversely, more overwhelmed?  

Evan: Yeah, I’d say I’ve had some ups and downs. I tried to set some boundaries at work—like turning off notifications after 6 PM—and that helped a little. But then, with my dad’s meds not being consistent and some urgent caregiving calls, I felt guilty for not being able to do more.  

**10:20**  
Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like you’re making efforts to create boundaries, which is great. And caregiving, especially for someone with dementia, can be unpredictable and emotionally draining. Whenever those calls come in, what kind of feelings or thoughts tend to surface?  

Evan: Mostly, I feel anxious—like I should fix things immediately. Sometimes I get frustrated with myself for not being able to ‘solve’ everything right away. And I worry about him, of course, but also about how this stress is affecting my own health and work.  

**10:30**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s very understandable. It’s natural to want to fix things, especially when someone we love is hurting. You’re also noticing the impact on yourself—those are important insights. Have you been able to share these feelings with anyone else, like your partner or a friend?  

Evan: Not really. I tend to keep things in. I don’t want to worry my partner, and I don’t want to seem like I’m complaining at work. I guess I just try to handle it myself.  

**10:40**  
Dr. Bianchi: Keeping things inside can sometimes add to the stress. It’s great that you’re aware of that. Building a support network can help lighten the emotional load. Have you thought about who in your life might be someone you could turn to, even just to vent or get some support?  

Evan: Maybe my sister. She’s close by and has helped with my dad before. But I haven’t really reached out much lately. I also worry about burdening her.  

**10:50**  
Dr. Bianchi: Reaching out can be hard, especially when you’re worried about being a burden. But often, sharing your feelings can help you feel less isolated and more supported. Would you be open to exploring ways to communicate your needs to her or others in your circle?  

Evan: Yeah, I think so. I guess I just need to get over the initial hesitation.  

**11:00**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good step. Sometimes, framing it as seeking support rather than burdening someone can make it easier. Let’s also consider some practical self-care strategies. What activities or routines have you tried, if any, to take care of yourself amid all this?  

Evan: Honestly, I haven’t been very consistent. I try to do a quick workout in the mornings, but lately, I’ve been skipping it because I’m too tired or distracted. I also find it hard to sleep well—my mind keeps racing.  

**11:10**  
Dr. Bianchi: Sleep and physical activity are definitely important for managing stress. When your mind is racing at night, do you notice specific thoughts that come up?  

Evan: Mostly about work deadlines or worries about my dad. Sometimes I replay conversations or think about what I could have done differently.  

**11:20**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s quite common—racing thoughts about responsibilities and outcomes. We could explore some techniques to help calm your mind before bed, like relaxation exercises or mindfulness. Would you be interested in trying those?  

Evan: Yeah, I’d like that. I’m willing to try anything that could help me get better sleep and feel a bit more grounded.  

**11:30**  
Dr. Bianchi: Great. We’ll incorporate some short mindfulness practices into our next sessions. Also, since you mentioned work stress, have you thought about setting clearer boundaries around your on-call hours or delegating tasks when possible?  

Evan: I have. I’ve been trying to push back on some projects, but it’s difficult because I don’t want to let my team down. Still, I realize I need to protect my own time better.  

**11:40**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very responsible attitude, Evan. Setting boundaries is a form of self-care and can help prevent burnout. We can brainstorm some ways to communicate your limits effectively at work.  

Evan: That would be helpful. I want to stay on top of things but also be present for my family.  

**11:50**  
Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like your goals are balancing work, caregiving, and your own well-being. Over the next few weeks, we can develop a personalized plan that includes boundary setting, support network development, and self-care routines.  

Evan: That sounds good. I think having a plan would make me feel less overwhelmed.  

**12:00**  
Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. For today, as homework, I’d like you to identify one person you feel comfortable reaching out to this week, even if just to share a small worry or thank them for their support. Also, try a simple relaxation exercise before bed tonight—like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.  

Evan: I can do that. Thanks, Serena. It feels good to have some concrete steps.  

**12:10**  
Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. We’ll continue working on these strategies and supporting you through this. I look forward to hearing how it goes next week.  

Evan: Me too. Thanks again.  

**12:20**  
Dr. Bianchi: You’re welcome, Evan. Take care until then.
