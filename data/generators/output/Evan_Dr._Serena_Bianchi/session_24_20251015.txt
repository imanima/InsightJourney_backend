[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Hi Evan, good to see you again. How are you feeling today as we start our session?  

[Evan]: Hi, Serena. I’m a bit tired, honestly. The past week has been a bit overwhelming with work and caring for my dad. But I’m glad to be here.  

[10:05] Dr. Bianchi: It’s good you’re here. I remember last time we talked about some of the stressors from your caregiving role. How have things been since then?  

[Evan]: Well, I’ve been trying to keep up with work while managing my dad’s appointments and his daily needs. Sometimes I feel like I’m running on empty. I noticed I’m more irritable at home and at work.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable given everything you’re juggling. Have you been able to recognize when you’re starting to feel overwhelmed?  

[Evan]: I think so. I catch myself snapping at my wife more often, and I feel tense even during meetings. But I also feel guilty taking time for myself, so I tend to push through.  

[10:15] Dr. Bianchi: Guilt around self-care is common, especially when caring for others. Last time, we touched on the importance of setting boundaries and scheduling small moments of rest. Have you tried any new strategies since then?  

[Evan]: I started a brief breathing exercise during lunch, just five minutes. It helps a bit, but I haven’t been consistent. Sometimes I forget or feel I don’t have the time.  

[10:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start. Building consistency can be challenging, especially with your busy schedule. Let’s explore what might help you integrate these moments more easily. Maybe setting reminders or pairing self-care with existing routines?  

[Evan]: Yeah, I could try that. Maybe I’ll set a reminder on my phone. Also, I realized I don’t have a clear support network outside of my wife and me. I tend to keep it all in.  

[10:25] Dr. Bianchi: Noticing that is a significant insight. Building a support system can lighten your load and provide emotional relief. Have you thought about reaching out to friends, colleagues, or community groups?  

[Evan]: I have a couple of friends from work who’ve gone through similar situations with aging parents, but I haven’t really opened up to them. I guess I’m worried about seeming weak or burdening them.  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: Those concerns are understandable. Sometimes, sharing your experience can deepen your connections and reduce feelings of isolation. Would you feel comfortable exploring what a supportive conversation with one of them might look like?  

[Evan]: Maybe. I suppose I could start by just saying I need someone to talk to about my dad and work stress.  

[10:35] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a manageable first step. Remember, it’s okay to ask for support; it doesn’t make you weak. And sharing can also help others feel more connected and less alone.  

[Evan]: Yeah, I see that. I think I’ll try to reach out this week.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s also revisit your work-life boundaries. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed at work. How are you managing your on-call responsibilities lately?  

[Evan]: Honestly, I’ve been taking my phone off silent during family time, but then I worry about missing urgent alerts. It’s a constant tension between wanting to disconnect and feeling responsible.  

[10:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common dilemma. Setting clear boundaries around work notifications can help, like designated ‘off’ hours. Have you considered creating a specific protocol for urgent alerts, so you know when it’s truly necessary to respond?  

[Evan]: Not really. Maybe I could talk to my team about setting expectations for after-hours responses. That might help.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a proactive approach. Communicating your boundaries can protect your time and energy. Now, thinking more broadly, how do you feel about your overall self-care and wellness?  

[Evan]: Honestly, I haven’t been taking good care of myself. I’m mostly just trying to keep everything afloat. I notice I’m neglecting exercise and sleep, which probably makes everything worse.  

[10:55] Dr. Bianchi: Recognizing that is an important first step. Small, consistent self-care practices—like sleep routines or brief physical activity—can make a difference over time. Would you be open to creating a simple self-care plan tailored to your schedule?  

[Evan]: Yeah, I think I could try that. Maybe I’ll start with a fixed bedtime and a quick walk in the mornings.  

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a solid plan. Let’s also keep in mind that balance is an ongoing process. Over the next few weeks, we can check in on how these strategies are working and adjust as needed.  

[Evan]: Thanks, Serena. I feel like I have some clear steps now, which helps.  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Before we wrap up, do you want to set any specific goals for the coming week?  

[Evan]: Yes. I’ll reach out to at least one friend about my dad, set a work boundary around after-hours responses, and start my new sleep routine.  

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent goals. Remember, progress is about small steps, and I’m here to support you. Let’s check in on these next time. Anything else you want to mention before we finish?  

[Evan]: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Serena.  

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: You’re welcome, Evan. Take good care of yourself this week, and I look forward to hearing how it goes. See you next week.  

[Evan]: Thanks, see you then.
