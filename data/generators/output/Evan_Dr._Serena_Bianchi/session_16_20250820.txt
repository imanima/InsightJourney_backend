[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?  
(Evan shifts slightly in his chair, looks a bit tired but attentive.)  

[10:05] Evan: Morning, Dr. Bianchi. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The caregiving for my dad is still intense, but I’ve managed to carve out some time for myself, which I think helps. Still feeling pretty stretched, though.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Caring for someone with dementia is a demanding role, and it’s great you’re recognizing the importance of carving out time for yourself. What’s been the most challenging part this week?  

(Evan leans forward slightly, voice tinged with fatigue.)  

[10:15] Evan: Honestly, it’s the unpredictability. Some days Dad is relatively calm, but others, he gets agitated or confused, and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. Plus, work has been busier with some new projects, so I’ve been trying to juggle everything without dropping the ball.  

[10:20] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like the unpredictability at home combined with work stress is creating a lot of pressure. Have you noticed any particular triggers at home or ways you’re currently coping when things get intense?  

(Evan pauses, thinking.)  

[10:25] Evan: Well, when Dad gets agitated, I try to stay calm and remind myself it’s the illness, not him. Sometimes I step away briefly—go outside or take some deep breaths. But honestly, I still feel overwhelmed most days.  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good start—recognizing that it’s the illness and not him. Deep breathing and stepping away are helpful techniques. Do you feel supported in this? Are there others you can turn to when things get tough?  

(Evan hesitates, then nods slowly.)  

[10:35] Evan: I have a couple of friends who check in on me, and my partner has been supportive. But I don’t want to burden them too much. Sometimes I feel like I’m managing everything on my own.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: Feeling like you’re carrying everything alone can be exhausting. Let’s explore your support system a bit more. Who else could you reach out to, or what kind of support might help lighten your load?  

Evan looks thoughtful, then responds.  

[10:45] Evan: Maybe I could talk more openly with my partner about how overwhelmed I feel, rather than just trying to handle it silently. I think I tend to keep it in to avoid worrying her.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very insightful observation. Sharing your feelings can foster connection and help her understand what you’re going through. Would you be comfortable practicing a way to express your needs to her in our next session?  

(Evan nods slightly, appearing a bit more engaged.)  

[10:55] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s also revisit your self-care routines. Last time, you mentioned trying to schedule some activities for yourself. How has that been going?  

Evan fidgets, then speaks.  

[11:00] Evan: I’ve managed to go for a run twice this week, which felt good. I also started blocking out some time on weekends to disconnect from work emails. It’s a small step, but I think it helps me reset.  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: That’s excellent progress—these small, consistent actions can add up to a big difference. How do you feel emotionally after these activities? Do they help reduce your stress?  

Evan considers, then responds.  

[11:10] Evan: Yeah, I do feel a bit more grounded afterward. It’s like a moment of clarity before going back into the chaos. Still, I worry about maintaining this balance long-term.  

[11:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a common concern. Building sustainable routines is key. We can work together to develop a flexible self-care plan that adapts to the unpredictability of your days. Would you like to explore some specific strategies for integrating self-care seamlessly into your busy schedule?  

Evan nods, looking slightly more optimistic.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. And as we’ve been working on, setting boundaries at work is also important. Have you been able to implement any limits around your on-call hours or workload?  

(Evan nods slowly.)  

[11:25] Evan: I’ve started turning off notifications after hours and letting my team know I won’t be available for urgent issues during certain times. It’s a work in progress, but I’m trying to be more firm about it.  

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a significant step toward protecting your personal time. Remember, establishing boundaries is a process, and it’s okay to adjust as needed. How do you feel about these changes?  

(Evan smiles slightly.)  

[11:35] Evan: Honestly, it feels good to have some control back. I think I’ve been so focused on managing everyone else that I forgot about my own limits.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a powerful realization. Recognizing your limits is essential for maintaining your well-being. As we move forward, we can continue refining your support network, self-care, and boundaries to help you feel more balanced.  

(Evan nods, visibly more relaxed.)  

[11:45] Dr. Bianchi: For next week, I’d like you to practice sharing one specific need or feeling with your partner—something small but meaningful—and notice how it feels. We’ll explore that in our next session. Does that sound good?  

(Evan nods affirmatively.)  

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Before we finish, do you have any questions or anything else you’d like to share today?  

Evan shakes his head.  

[11:55] Evan: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Dr. Bianchi. I appreciate the space to talk through all of this.  

[11:59] Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome, Evan. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, and I look forward to seeing how these new strategies work for you next week. Take care until then.  

(They exchange a warm, supportive look as the session concludes.)
