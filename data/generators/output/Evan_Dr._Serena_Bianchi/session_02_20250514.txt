[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Evan shifts in his chair, looking a bit tired)  
  
[10:05] Evan: Morning, Dr. Bianchi. Honestly, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. The stress from work and caring for my dad has been pretty intense lately. I feel like I’m running on empty most days.  

[10:07] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with so many responsibilities. Last time, we talked about some ways to acknowledge your stress — have you noticed any particular triggers or moments that feel especially challenging?  

[10:10] Evan: Yeah. The worst seems to be during the evenings, after I get home from work. That’s when I check in on my dad, and sometimes I get calls from work that just pile up. It’s like I never really get a break.  

[10:12] Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like that transition from work to caregiving is particularly hard for you. Do you notice any physical or emotional signs that come up during those times?  

[10:15] Evan: I tend to get headaches, and my shoulders feel tense. Sometimes I feel a knot in my stomach. It’s like I’m constantly on edge.  

[10:17] Dr. Bianchi: Those are important signals. Recognizing them is a key step in managing stress. Have you been able to use any of the grounding or breathing techniques we discussed last time during those moments?  

[10:20] Evan: I’ve tried, but honestly, it’s hard to remember when everything is piling up. I get caught up in trying to fix things or just pushing through.  

[10:22] Dr. Bianchi: That's common, especially when stress levels are high. Maybe we can explore ways to make those techniques more accessible during your busiest moments. But first, I’d like to revisit your support system. How connected do you feel to friends, family, or colleagues who could help lighten your load?  

[10:25] Evan: I’ve reached out to a couple of friends, but I don’t want to burden them too much. My sister lives nearby, but she’s busy with her own family. Colleagues at work are supportive, but I mostly keep work and personal life separate.  

[10:28] Dr. Bianchi: It’s good that you have some connections. Sometimes, sharing your feelings, even if just a little, can create a sense of relief. Have you considered being more explicit about your needs with your sister or colleagues, or perhaps setting specific boundaries around work calls after hours?  

[10:30] Evan: I guess I haven’t really asked for help directly. I worry about seeming weak or like I’m not managing well enough. And as for boundaries, I’m often on call, so it’s hard to disconnect completely.  

[10:33] Dr. Bianchi: Those are very common concerns. Part of what we’re working on is building your confidence in expressing your needs and setting boundaries that protect your well-being. How do you feel about trying to communicate your limits more clearly, perhaps with your team or family?  

[10:36] Evan: I think I could try, but I’m not sure how to start that conversation without feeling guilty or like I’m letting people down.  

[10:38] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a natural fear. Remember, setting boundaries is a form of self-care and actually helps you be more present and effective when you are with others. Maybe we can role-play some ways to express your limits gently but assertively?  

[10:40] Evan: Yeah, I think that might help. I want to be able to say no sometimes without feeling bad about it.  

[10:43] Dr. Bianchi: Great. Let’s work on some language for that. But before that, I’d like to check in on your self-care routine. Have you been able to carve out any time for yourself during the week?  

[10:45] Evan: Honestly, not really. Between work deadlines and caregiving, I feel guilty about taking time off. I know I need to, but the guilt kind of stops me.  

[10:48] Dr. Bianchi: Guilt is a common obstacle. Sometimes, reframing self-care as necessary and non-negotiable can help. How about we brainstorm small, manageable ways to incorporate brief moments of rest or activities that recharge you?  

[10:50] Evan: Like maybe a five-minute walk outside or listening to some music? I could try that during lunch or even quick breaks.  

[10:52] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds very doable. Those small acts can accumulate and help reduce overall stress. As we progress, we can also look into scheduling dedicated self-care time, even if it’s brief.  

[10:55] Evan: Yeah, I’d like that. I realize I tend to put myself last, but I see how important it is.  

[10:57] Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely. Remember, taking care of yourself allows you to be more present for your dad, your work, and yourself. Before we finish today, let’s set a couple of action items. Would that be okay?  

[10:59] Evan: Yes, that sounds good.  

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: First, try to identify one boundary you’d like to communicate—maybe about work calls or visits—and practice expressing it in your own words. Second, pick one small self-care activity, like a five-minute walk or a brief relaxation exercise, and schedule it into your day. We’ll review how it went next week.  

[11:02] Evan: I can do that. Thanks, Dr. Bianchi. I already feel a bit lighter just talking about it.  

[11:04] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that, Evan. Remember, progress takes time, and each small step counts. I look forward to hearing how it goes next week. Have a good rest of your day.  

[11:06] Evan: Thanks, you too. See you next time.
