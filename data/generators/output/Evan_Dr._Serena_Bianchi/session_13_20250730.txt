**[10:00] Dr. Bianchi:** Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
**[Evan:]** Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, but I’ve been trying to keep up with the strategies we discussed.  

**[10:10] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s good to hear you’re actively trying to implement some of the tools. Can you tell me more about what’s been most challenging this past week?  
**[Evan:]** Well, managing my father’s care has been tough. He’s getting more confused, and the on-call stress at work is still high. I feel like I’m constantly juggling, and sometimes I worry I’m not doing enough on either side.  

**[10:15] Dr. Bianchi:** It sounds like you’re under a lot of pressure, feeling pulled in different directions. Have you noticed any specific moments where your stress peaks?  
**[Evan:]** Yeah, especially during late nights when I get called for emergencies at work, or when I see my dad’s condition worsening. The guilt hits me—I wish I could do more for him.  

**[10:20] Dr. Bianchi:** That guilt is very understandable. It’s common for caregivers to feel that way. Let’s try to explore that a bit—what does that guilt look like for you emotionally?  
**[Evan:]** It feels like a heavy weight in my chest, almost like I’m failing him, even though I know I’m doing my best. Sometimes I get frustrated at myself for not having more time or patience.  

**[10:25] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a very honest reflection. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings without judgment. Over the past sessions, we’ve worked on recognizing your emotions and setting boundaries. How have those strategies been working for you in managing this guilt?  
**[Evan:]** They help sometimes, especially when I remind myself that I can't do everything at once. But in moments of crisis, I still feel overwhelmed and tend to spiral. I’ve started to journal about these feelings, which helps a little.  

**[10:30] Dr. Bianchi:** Journaling is a wonderful tool. It allows you to process those intense emotions safely. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed during crises—what are some small steps you could take in those moments to ground yourself?  
**[Evan:]** I’ve tried deep breathing and focusing on what I can control—like taking a quick break or asking a colleague for help. Sometimes I forget to pause, but I’m getting better at it.  

**[10:35] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s progress. Remember, these moments are opportunities to practice compassion for yourself. Now, let’s look at your support system. Who do you currently turn to when things feel heavy?  
**[Evan:]** Mostly my wife, Sarah, but she’s also busy with her own work and our kids. Sometimes I hesitate to burden her with everything. I’ve also reached out to a couple of friends, but I don’t want to seem like I’m always complaining.  

**[10:40] Dr. Bianchi:** It’s natural to want to protect loved ones from feeling overwhelmed. Have you considered expanding your support network or perhaps sharing your feelings with a professional, like a counselor or support group?  
**[Evan:]** I’ve thought about it, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to open up about everything. I worry about seeming weak or needy.  

**[10:45] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a common concern. Remember, seeking support is a sign of strength, especially when caring for someone else. We can work on ways to share your feelings gradually, in a way that feels safe for you. How does that sound?  
**[Evan:]** That sounds good. I think I could try to open up more, even just a little at a time.  

**[10:50] Dr. Bianchi:** Excellent. Now, let’s shift toward self-care. Have you been able to schedule any moments for yourself during the week?  
**[Evan:]** Not really. Between work and caregiving, I feel guilty taking time off, even just for a walk or a quick coffee. I tell myself I need to be available all the time.  

**[10:55] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a very common pattern. But self-care isn’t selfish; it’s essential. Even small acts—like a five-minute breathing exercise or a brief walk—can make a difference. Would you be willing to set one small self-care goal for the upcoming week?  
**[Evan:]** Yes, I think I can commit to taking a short walk during lunch a few days this week. Maybe that’ll help clear my mind.  

**[11:00] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a great start. And remember, it’s about consistency, not perfection. As we’ve discussed, maintaining boundaries between work and home can also help reduce stress. Have there been any moments lately where you successfully set a boundary?  
**[Evan:]** Actually, yes. Last week, I turned off my work notifications after 6 PM, and I told my team I wouldn’t be available after that. It felt good to draw that line.  

**[11:05] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s wonderful progress. Setting those boundaries can protect your energy and help you be more present with your loved ones. Moving forward, let’s think about a plan to reinforce these boundaries and support your self-care goals. Would you like to explore specific strategies for that next week?  
**[Evan:]** Yes, I’d appreciate that. I want to make sure I follow through.  

**[11:10] Dr. Bianchi:** Great. To summarize today, we've acknowledged your ongoing stress and guilt, discussed expanding your support network gradually, and set a small self-care goal. Next session, we can focus on solidifying boundary-setting techniques and exploring ways to share your feelings more comfortably. How does that sound?  
**[Evan:]** That sounds helpful. Thanks, Serena. I feel a bit more hopeful after talking through all this.  

**[11:15] Dr. Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear that, Evan. Remember, you’re doing a lot just by being proactive and seeking support. Let’s keep building on these steps. For next week, try to practice your walk and reflect on how setting boundaries makes you feel. We’ll check in on those progress points.  
**[Evan:]** Will do. Thanks again. See you next week.  

**[11:20] Dr. Bianchi:** Take care, Evan. Have a good week, and be gentle with yourself.
