**[10:00] Dr. Bianchi:** Good morning, Evan. It’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
**[Evan]:** Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. The stress at work has been a little lighter, but caring for my dad is still tough. I’ve been feeling pretty exhausted.  

**[10:10] Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds challenging. It’s understandable to feel exhausted given everything you’re juggling. Let’s start by checking in—what’s been most prominent for you emotionally this past week?  

**[Evan]:** I think mostly frustration and guilt. I feel like I’m not doing enough at work or at home, and that makes me anxious, like I’m falling behind. Sometimes, I just want a break, but I also worry about my dad’s health.  

**[10:15] Dr. Bianchi:** It’s so common to feel torn between responsibilities, especially when caring for someone with dementia. You mentioned guilt—can you tell me more about that?  

**[Evan]:** Yeah, I often feel guilty when I have to step away from caring duties, even for a little while. Like, if I focus on work or go out with friends, I worry I’m neglecting my dad. But I also need some space to recharge.  

**[10:20] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a very natural feeling. Guilt often comes when we believe we should be doing more or better. How do you usually cope with those feelings?  

**[Evan]:** Not always well. I tend to push through and avoid thinking about it, but that just makes me more stressed. Sometimes I talk to my wife, but she’s exhausted too, so it’s hard to really unload.  

**[10:25] Dr. Bianchi:** It sounds like you’re carrying a lot on your shoulders, and the support system around you might be limited right now. Have you thought about who else you could turn to for support?  

**[Evan]:** Well, I have a few friends, but I don’t want to burden them. My wife is overwhelmed, too, so I mostly keep it to myself.  

**[10:30] Dr. Bianchi:** It’s common to feel reluctant to ask for help, especially when you’re so responsible. Let’s explore some ways you might build a broader support network without feeling like you’re imposing. Would that be okay?  

**[Evan]:** Yeah, I’d like that. I know I can’t do everything alone.  

**[10:35] Dr. Bianchi:** Great. Sometimes, mapping out your support system can help clarify who’s available and how to reach out. Are there people, maybe neighbors or community groups, that you could consider connecting with?  

**[Evan]:** I’ve thought about a local support group for caregivers, but I haven’t looked into it much. I guess I’m a little unsure about how to start.  

**[10:40] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a good idea. Support groups can be very helpful—they provide understanding and shared experiences. I can help you find some local options or online groups if you prefer. Would that be helpful?  

**[Evan]:** Yes, definitely. That might make me feel less isolated.  

**[10:45] Dr. Bianchi:** Excellent. Now, switching gears a bit—how are you doing with self-care? Have you been able to carve out any time for yourself?  

**[Evan]:** Not really. I try to go for a run or play video games, but it’s hard to relax when I’m constantly worried about my dad or work. I feel guilty even taking that time.  

**[10:50] Dr. Bianchi:** It’s common to feel that guilt. But self-care is essential—not just for your well-being, but so you can be more present and effective in your caregiving and work. Let’s try to create a simple self-care plan that feels manageable. What’s one activity you enjoy that you could do regularly?  

**[Evan]:** I like listening to music or taking short walks, but I often tell myself I don’t have time.  

**[10:55] Dr. Bianchi:** Even brief breaks can make a difference. How about setting aside 10 minutes a day for a walk or listening to your favorite music? We can schedule it at a time that feels natural for you—perhaps during lunch or after work?  

**[11:00] Evan]:** Yeah, I think I can do that. I’ll try to make it a routine.  

**[11:05] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a great start. Remember, small consistent steps can lead to meaningful change. As you implement this, notice how it affects your mood and stress levels. Would you be willing to keep a simple journal or notes about your self-care and how you’re feeling?  

**[Evan]:** Sure. I can do that. It might help me see if these small changes are making a difference.  

**[11:10] Dr. Bianchi:** Perfect. Before we wrap up today, I want to briefly revisit your work-life balance. How are things going in that area?  

**[Evan]:** It’s still a challenge. I’m on-call a lot, especially with the incident prediction system I manage. Sometimes, I feel like I never really disconnect. But I’ve started setting boundaries—like turning off notifications after hours.  

**[11:15] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a positive step. Boundaries are crucial for reducing burnout. How do you feel about those boundaries so far?  

**[Evan]:** They help, but I still worry about missing something important. It’s hard to fully relax when I know I might get called in.  

**[11:20] Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a common concern. We can explore ways to manage that anxiety, perhaps by creating a plan for urgent issues and trusting your system. Would you like to work on that next time?  

**[Evan]:** Yes, that would be helpful.  

**[11:25] Dr. Bianchi:** Excellent. To summarize today’s session: we discussed building your support network, establishing small but meaningful self-care routines, and strengthening boundaries around work. Your next steps include reaching out to a support group, implementing your self-care activity, and developing a plan for managing work-related anxiety. Does that sound good?  

**[Evan]:** Yes, it does. Thanks, Serena. I already feel a bit lighter just talking about it.  

**[11:30] Dr. Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing important work. I’ll see you next week, and in the meantime, feel free to reach out if anything urgent comes up.  

**[Evan]:** Will do. Thanks again.  

**[11:35] Dr. Bianchi:** Take care, Evan. Have a good week ahead.
