**[10:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**[Evan]:** Hi, Serena. Thanks. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, honestly. Work has been intense, and with my dad’s health, I sometimes feel like I’m juggling too many balls at once.  

**[10:05] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That sounds very challenging. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with so much on your plate. Would you like to start by sharing what’s been most prominent for you this week?  

**[Evan]:** Well, I’ve been feeling pretty stressed about work deadlines, especially since I’ve had to step in more with my dad lately. His condition has worsened, and I worry about how much longer I can keep up this pace without burning out.  

**[10:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** It sounds like caregiving and work are both demanding a lot from you right now. When you think about your stress levels, what stands out the most — is it the physical exhaustion, the emotional strain, or perhaps worries about the future?  

**[Evan]:** Definitely the emotional strain. I feel guilty sometimes because I can't always be there for my dad, and at the same time, I don’t want my work to suffer. It’s like I’m pulled in two directions.  

**[10:15] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That inner pull can be exhausting. You mentioned feeling guilty—what’s that guilt telling you about your values or expectations you have for yourself?  

**[Evan]:** I guess I’ve always believed I should be able to handle everything, that I should be the strong one. But lately, I realize I’ve been pushing myself too hard, and it’s taking a toll.  

**[10:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Recognizing that pressure is an important step. Sometimes, our internal expectations can become burdensome, especially when they don’t match what’s realistic. Have you noticed any particular moments when that guilt intensifies?  

**[Evan]:** Yeah, especially after long nights of work when I get a call from my sister about dad, or when I have to leave work early to visit him. I feel like I’m not doing enough.  

**[10:25] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of responsibility, both professionally and personally. Would it help to explore ways to acknowledge your efforts and set some boundaries, so you don’t feel overwhelmed?  

**[Evan]:** I think so. I’ve been trying to be more organized about my schedule, but I still struggle to say no or delegate.  

**[10:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a common challenge, especially for someone who’s responsible and organized by nature. Let’s look at some concrete ways to support your well-being. Last week, we discussed creating a support network. How has that been going?  

**[Evan]:** I’ve reached out to a couple of friends and my sister more often. They’ve been helpful, but I still hesitate to ask for more support because I don’t want to burden anyone.  

**[10:35] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** It’s natural to hesitate, but often, sharing our struggles can strengthen connections rather than burden others. Maybe we can identify specific ways they can support you, so it feels less like a burden.  

**[Evan]:** That makes sense. I think I could ask my sister to check in with dad more often, or maybe my friends could help with some errands.  

**[10:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Those are excellent ideas. Let’s also consider your self-care. Have you been able to schedule any time for yourself?  

**[Evan]:** Not really. When I do have free time, I often end up working on side projects or just zoning out in front of the TV. I know I need to do more.  

**[10:45] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** It’s good that you’re aware. Self-care isn’t always about big activities; sometimes, small, intentional moments can make a difference. Would you be open to creating a weekly self-care plan that includes specific, manageable activities?  

**[Evan]:** Yeah, I think that could help. Maybe even just 15 minutes a day of stretching or listening to music.  

**[10:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Great idea. Starting small can help build consistency without feeling overwhelming. As we progress, we can also explore boundary-setting strategies to help manage your work and caregiving roles better.  

**[10:55] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Before we end today, let’s set a couple of action steps. First, continue to reach out to your support network and specify ways they can help. Second, draft a simple self-care schedule for the upcoming week. Does that sound manageable?  

**[Evan]:** Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate having some concrete steps.  

**[10:58] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Wonderful. I’m proud of your openness today, Evan. Next session, we can check in on how these steps are going and explore any new feelings that come up.  

**[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Thank you for sharing today. Take care of yourself until then.  

**[11:00] End of session.**
