[10:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Hi Evan, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or events this week?

[Evan]: Hi, Serena. Thanks. It’s been a mixed week, honestly. The stress around my dad’s health has been pretty intense, but I also feel like I’ve made some progress in managing my work stress. 

[10:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s good to hear you’re noticing some progress. When you say the stress around your dad has been intense, can you tell me more about what that’s been like for you? What’s been most challenging?

[Evan]: Well, he’s been more agitated lately, which makes caregiving tougher. I find myself worrying about his safety, especially during the night when I’m on call. It’s like this constant low-level anxiety that never fully goes away. Sometimes I catch myself feeling guilty for being exhausted but also needing to keep going.

[10:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That sounds really draining—feeling responsible for him, yet also tired and overwhelmed. It’s understandable that guilt can creep in when you're under so much pressure. When you notice that guilt, what are some of the thoughts or feelings you experience?

[Evan]: I guess I think I should be doing more, or I feel like I’m failing him somehow. Like I’m not enough, even though I know logically I’m doing everything I can.

[10:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a very common feeling among caregivers—this sense of not doing enough, despite your efforts. It’s important to recognize that your dedication is significant. How have you been managing your own emotional needs amid all this?

[Evan]: Honestly, I’ve been avoiding it a bit. I’ve thrown myself into work—trying to stay busy, especially with my project deadlines. It helps distract me, but I know I can’t keep doing that forever without burning out.

[10:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Yes, avoidance can be a temporary shield, but it might also lead to more stress down the line. You mentioned work has been a refuge—can you tell me more about your experience balancing work and caregiving?

[Evan]: It’s a constant juggling act. I have to be on call, which means I’m rarely fully present at work or at home. Sometimes I feel guilty for not giving enough attention to my partner or myself. I feel like I’m losing control of my own life.

[10:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a powerful insight—feeling like control is slipping away. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when your responsibilities pull you in so many directions. Over our past sessions, we’ve worked on establishing boundaries and support networks. How have those strategies been working for you?

[Evan]: I’ve been trying to set some boundaries at work—like turning off notifications after hours—but it’s still hard. The nature of my job makes it tricky. As for support, I talked to a couple of friends, but I haven’t really opened up about how heavy it’s been.

[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a step forward, Evan—setting boundaries is key. Sometimes, opening up to trusted friends can help lighten the emotional load. Would you feel comfortable exploring some ways to deepen that support system or maybe identify new sources of support?

[Evan]: Yeah, I think that could help. I guess I’ve been hesitant to ask for help, partly because I don’t want to burden anyone, but I see now that I need to lean on others more.

[11:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Absolutely, seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. It’s also about sharing the load so you don’t carry everything alone. Let’s think about who in your network might be able to provide that support—family, friends, colleagues—and how you might approach opening up to them.

[Evan]: I could talk to my sister—she’s been asking how things are. Maybe I can be more honest with her about what I need.

[11:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That sounds like a very good step. Being honest about your needs can foster understanding and help you feel less isolated. Have you thought about specific self-care practices you could incorporate into your routine? Something manageable given your busy schedule?

[Evan]: I’ve been trying to squeeze in short walks, but I often skip them when I get overwhelmed. Maybe I could schedule them more intentionally, even if just for 10 minutes during lunch.

[11:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a great idea—protecting small pockets of time for yourself can make a difference. Also, considering your stress levels, are there relaxation techniques or mindfulness practices you might find helpful?

[Evan]: I’ve heard about breathing exercises, but I haven’t really tried them seriously. I’m willing to give it a shot, especially when I start feeling overwhelmed during the day.

[11:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a good plan. Even simple breathing exercises can help reduce immediate stress. We can explore some specific techniques to try before our next session. Now, considering your goals of managing caregiving stress, building a support network, and maintaining work-life balance, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?

[Evan]: I think I’ve taken some small steps, but it’s still a long road. I feel more aware of what I need, though, and that’s a start. I’m also realizing I need to be kinder to myself.

[11:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a significant realization, Evan. Self-compassion is crucial, especially when you’re under so much pressure. Remember, progress isn’t always linear, and small steps add up over time. For next week, let’s focus on strengthening your support system and practicing a couple of self-care techniques. Does that sound good?

[Evan]: Yes, it does. I appreciate having a space to talk openly about all this. It’s helpful.

[12:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that. Before we wrap up, are there any other thoughts or feelings you want to share today?

[Evan]: Just that I feel a bit more hopeful, even if things are tough. Knowing I’m working on it makes a difference.

[12:05] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s wonderful to hear — hope is a powerful motivator. Keep taking those small steps, and remember, I’m here to support you. Our next session is scheduled for next week. Take care of yourself until then, Evan.

[Evan]: Thanks, Serena. See you next week.
