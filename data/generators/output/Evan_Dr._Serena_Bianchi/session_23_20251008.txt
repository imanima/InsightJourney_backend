**[10:00]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Good morning, Evan. It’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**Evan:** Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and I’m still trying to manage everything at home with my dad.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That sounds challenging. Do you want to tell me more about what’s been most overwhelming for you lately?  

**Evan:** Well, the on-call stress is constant. I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes because of an alert, and then I can’t fall back asleep. Plus, caring for my dad — it’s a lot of emotional weight. I feel like I’m running on fumes.  

**[10:30]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** It’s understandable to feel exhausted. You’re carrying a lot, and it’s natural to feel drained. Last time, we talked about trying to develop some support networks. Have you been able to connect with anyone for help or support?  

**Evan:** I did reach out to a couple of friends, but I hesitated—they’re busy, and I didn’t want to burden them too much. My wife is supportive, but she’s also overwhelmed with her own work. I guess I’m feeling a bit isolated in all this.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a common feeling among caregivers—wanting to reach out but feeling hesitant or guilty. It’s good you’ve spoken to friends. Sometimes, sharing small updates can ease the burden. Have you considered joining a caregiver support group?  

**Evan:** I’ve thought about it, but I’m not sure I have the time. The schedule is so unpredictable.  

**[10:55]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Time is a real challenge, especially with your responsibilities. Let’s explore some ways to make space for self-care without feeling overwhelmed. You mentioned feeling isolated; maybe we can look into creating a small, manageable support system, even if it’s just brief check-ins with someone.  

**Evan:** That might help. I do try to keep up with my wife, but we’re both just exhausted most nights. Sometimes I feel guilty taking time for myself.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** Guilt can be a heavy weight. Remember, self-care isn’t selfish—it’s essential for maintaining your capacity to care for others. We can work on some quick, practical self-care strategies you can do even during busy days.  

**Evan:** I’d like that. I’ve also been noticing that my stress affects my work. I get distracted easily, and I worry about making mistakes.  

**[11:10]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** That’s a common experience when stress levels rise. Have you tried any specific techniques to manage your stress during the day?  

**Evan:** Not consistently. I sometimes do deep breathing, but I forget when things get hectic. I think I need more structure around it.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** Let’s develop a simple, quick routine you can use during the day—maybe a couple of breaths or a brief pause—something you can do on your phone or desk. Would that be helpful?  

**Evan:** Yeah, I think I could do that. Having a plan might make me more likely to remember.  

**[11:30]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Great. So, to summarize, we’re looking at building your support network, integrating quick self-care routines, and managing work stress with practical grounding techniques. How does that sound?  

**Evan:** It sounds good. I feel a bit more hopeful, honestly. Just having some clear steps makes it seem more doable.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is gradual, and it’s okay to have days where things feel tough. We’ll keep working on these strategies, and I’ll be here to support you.  

**Evan:** Thanks, Serena. I appreciate it.  

**[11:50]**  
**Dr. Bianchi:** Before we wrap up, let’s set one action item for next week. Perhaps you can try reaching out to one support person, even with a short message, and practice a quick self-care routine twice a day. How does that sound?  

**Evan:** That works. I’ll give it a shot.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** Excellent. And if anything comes up or feels overwhelming, remember you can reach out. Next session, we’ll check in on how those steps went and explore any new challenges.  

**Evan:** Sounds good. Thanks again, Serena.  

**Dr. Bianchi:** You’re welcome, Evan. Take care of yourself until then.
