**[10:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Good morning, Evan. It's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
**[Evan]:** Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The stress from work and caring for my dad has been pretty overwhelming lately. I feel like I’m constantly on edge.  

**[10:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That sounds exhausting. You mentioned last time that balancing your work responsibilities and your caregiving role has been a challenge. Can you tell me more about what's been particularly difficult this week?  

**[Evan]:** Sure. So, with my dad’s condition worsening, I’ve been handling more of his day-to-day needs. Sometimes I get calls in the middle of the night from his care home or emergency alerts from my monitoring system at work. It’s hard to switch gears between those two worlds.  

**[10:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** It sounds like your role as a caregiver and your job are both demanding, and they’re pulling you in different directions. When you’re in these moments, what physical or emotional signals do you notice?  

**[Evan]:** I notice my shoulders tensing up, and I feel this constant tightness in my chest. Mentally, I get distracted easily—I can’t focus on one thing without thinking about the other. Sometimes I feel guilty, like I’m not giving enough to either side.  

**[10:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a very common experience among caregivers who are balancing multiple responsibilities. It’s like your mind is trying to stay on alert all the time. Have you noticed any specific triggers that heighten these feelings?  

**[Evan]:** Yes, definitely. When I get a call from the care home late at night or a system alert at work, it just spikes my anxiety. I feel like I’m constantly waiting for the next crisis.  

**[10:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** So, those moments seem to activate a kind of hyper-vigilance in you. In our previous sessions, we talked about the importance of recognizing these stress signals early. Have you been able to implement any strategies for grounding yourself in those moments?  

**[Evan]:** I’ve tried taking a few deep breaths, but honestly, it doesn’t always help. Sometimes I just feel stuck—like I can’t slow my mind down.  

**[10:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s understandable. It’s a process, and these strategies take time to build into your routine. We also discussed earlier about developing a stronger support system. How has that been going?  

**[11:00] Evan]:** I’ve reached out to a couple of friends from work who have experience with caregiving. They’ve been helpful, but I haven’t yet shared everything I’m feeling. I think I’m still hesitant about appearing vulnerable.  

**[Dr. Serena Bianchi]:** That’s a very common feeling, especially with people who seem to have it together professionally. Opening up can feel risky, but it often helps lighten the load. Would you be open to exploring what might make it easier for you to share more openly with your support network?  

**[Evan]:** Yeah, I think I’d like that. I guess I worry about being perceived as weak or incapable. But I also know I can’t keep going like this alone.  

**[11:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a really insightful recognition. Building trust in your support system is key. We can work on small ways to start sharing more, even just expressing your needs or feelings without feeling judged. How does that sound?  

**[Evan]:** That sounds good. I think I need to practice being more honest about what I’m experiencing.  

**[11:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Great. Let’s also revisit your self-care plan. Last time, you mentioned wanting to carve out time for activities that help you recharge. Have you been able to prioritize any of that?  

**[Evan]:** I’ve tried to schedule short walks during my lunch break, but sometimes work gets in the way. I also started listening to some calming music when I get home, which helps a bit.  

**[11:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Those are excellent steps. Even small moments of self-care can make a difference over time. We can work on creating a more structured self-care schedule that fits into your busy days. Would you like to explore some specific activities that bring you joy or relaxation?  

**[Evan]:** Yes, I’d like that. I used to enjoy playing guitar, but I haven’t picked it up in months. Maybe reconnecting with that could help.  

**[11:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Reconnecting with hobbies like guitar can be very restorative. It also provides a mental break from constant stress. Let’s set a goal for this week to dedicate at least 15 minutes a day to that. How does that sound?  

**[Evan]:** Sounds doable. I think I need that.  

**[11:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Excellent. To summarize, today we’ve identified some of your stress triggers and your emotional signals. We’ve discussed expanding your support network and incorporating small, meaningful self-care activities. Next session, we can check in on how these strategies are working and explore any new challenges.  

**[Evan]:** Thank you, Serena. I already feel a bit lighter just talking about it.  

**[12:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, progress is about small steps, and you’re making them. For next week, try to keep a brief stress and mood journal and note any moments where you felt overwhelmed or managed well. We’ll review that together.  

**[Evan]:** I will. Thanks again.  

**[12:05] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** You’re very welcome. Take care of yourself this week, Evan. See you next time.
