[10:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?  

[Evan]: Hi, Serena. Thanks. I’d say overall, it’s been a mixed bag. The stress from work and caring for my dad is still pretty intense, but I feel like I’m starting to recognize some patterns I hadn’t noticed before.  

[10:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a good observation—that recognizing patterns can be a key step. Can you tell me more about what’s been coming up for you lately?  

[Evan]: Well, I’ve been feeling more overwhelmed during the week, especially on days when I get a lot of system alerts at work. I keep thinking I should be able to handle everything better, but it’s like I hit a limit. Then, on top of that, my dad’s health is declining. Sometimes I feel guilty when I focus on work instead of him.  

[10:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: It sounds like you’re carrying quite a bit—both professionally and personally. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed and guilty. When you notice those feelings, where do you feel them in your body?  

[Evan]: I guess, mostly in my chest and shoulders. It’s like a tightness I can’t really shake off. Sometimes my jaw clenches too.  

[10:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Noticing that physical sensation is an important step. It helps us connect with what’s happening emotionally underneath. When you experience that tightness, what thoughts are going through your mind?  

[Evan]: Mostly, I’m thinking about whether I’m doing enough, if I’m neglecting my dad, or if I should be working more efficiently to make up for lost time. Sometimes I worry I’m messing everything up.  

[10:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Those are heavy thoughts—feeling like you’re not doing enough, or that you’re falling short. Do you remember last week we talked about your support system? How’s that been going?  

[Evan]: I’ve been trying to reach out more to some friends, but I find it hard to open up fully. I don’t want to bother anyone or seem like I’m complaining. But I did talk to my partner about how tired I am, and that helped a bit.  

[10:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s progress—being able to share some of your feelings with your partner. How did that conversation go for you?  

[Evan]: It was tough at first. I hesitated because I didn’t want to seem weak. But once I started talking, I felt a relief. She listened and offered support, which made me realize I don’t have to carry everything alone.  

[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s a significant step—leaning into your support system. In our previous sessions, we discussed creating some boundaries around work and caregiving. Have you been able to implement any of those boundaries?  

[Evan]: I’ve started setting specific work hours and turning off notifications after 7 PM. It’s still a work in progress, but I notice I’m less anxious in the evenings. I also told my team I might not always be immediately available for urgent issues outside those hours.  

[11:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s excellent. Establishing boundaries is crucial in managing stress. How does it feel to enforce those boundaries?  

[Evan]: At first, a bit uncomfortable—like I was worried about missing something or disappointing my team. But now, I see it’s helping me breathe easier, and I can focus better during working hours.  

[11:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s wonderful progress. Now, regarding your dad’s care, have you been able to develop any strategies or routines to balance that with your work?  

[Evan]: I’ve started using a schedule to plan visits and calls with him, and I’ve asked a home health aide to come in a few times a week. It’s helped me feel less guilty about not being there all the time. But some days, I still feel torn between my responsibilities.  

[11:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel torn—caregiving is emotionally demanding. How are you managing your own self-care amidst all this?  

[Evan]: Honestly, I haven’t been great at it. I’ll sometimes forget to eat or just collapse on the couch after work. I know I need to prioritize myself more, but I don’t know where to start.  

[11:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Self-care can feel like another task on your list, but it’s essential. Let’s explore some small, manageable steps you can take. For example, maybe a 5-minute breathing exercise or a brief walk outside. Would that feel doable?  

[Evan]: Yeah, I think I could do a quick walk or some stretching. I just forget sometimes when I’m in the zone.  

[11:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi: That’s normal—awareness is a good first step. We can set reminders for these small practices. Also, how about creating a weekly self-care plan together? Something realistic that fits into your schedule?  

[Evan]: I’d like that. I think if I had a plan, I’d be more likely to follow through.  

[12:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Great. We’ll work on that for next week. Before we finish today, what’s one thing you want to focus on between now and our next session?  

[Evan]: I want to keep practicing setting boundaries at work and try those small self-care activities. Also, I’ll keep reaching out to my support network more.  

[12:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Those are excellent goals. Remember, progress is about small steps, and each one adds up. I appreciate your openness today, Evan. We’re making meaningful strides.  

[Evan]: Thanks, Serena. I feel more hopeful about managing everything. Looking forward to our next session.  

[12:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi: Me too. Take care of yourself this week, and I’ll see you next time.
