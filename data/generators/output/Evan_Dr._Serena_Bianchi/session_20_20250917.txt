[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
(Evan offers a small smile, shifting slightly in his chair)  
Evan: Hi, Serena. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed this week. The stress at work has been high, and caring for my dad is taking a lot out of me.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds exhausting. You’re balancing quite a bit right now—work, caregiving, and your own well-being. Let’s start by checking in—what’s been the most challenging part for you lately?  

Evan: I think it’s the constant pressure at work, especially with all the system outages and the AI incident prediction tools going off late at night. I feel like I’m always on call, and I can’t really disconnect. Plus, my dad’s health is declining, and I worry about him all the time.  

[10:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a lot to handle. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when your responsibilities are so demanding. Let’s try to break down some of these stressors. Can you tell me about a recent time when you felt particularly stressed or overwhelmed?  

Evan: Last Thursday, there was a major system outage just as I was about to leave, and I stayed late trying to fix it remotely. Then I got home, and my dad was confused again, asking where I was. It’s hard to switch from work mode to caregiving mode so quickly.  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: That transition sounds very difficult. It’s like your work and caregiving roles are bleeding into each other. Have you noticed any specific physical or emotional signs when you’re feeling this stress?  

Evan: Yeah, I get tension headaches, and I feel anxious, like I can’t breathe sometimes. I also notice I’m more irritable, even with my partner, Mira.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: Noticing those signs is a good first step. It shows you’re aware of how stress manifests in your body and mind. Last week, we talked about creating small moments of self-care. Have you been able to practice any of those?  

Evan: I tried to do a five-minute breathing exercise in the morning, but honestly, it’s hard to find the time. I also scheduled a walk during lunch today, though I didn’t get to it because of a last-minute meeting.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: It’s great that you’re trying—every small effort counts. Maybe we can look at ways to integrate these practices more seamlessly into your day, even during busy times. Also, how has your support system been? Have you reached out to anyone for help or shared how you’re feeling?  

Evan: I’ve talked to Mira a bit, but I don’t want to burden her too much. My sister checks in sometimes, but she lives out of state. I don’t really have a lot of close friends nearby.  

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to feel hesitant about sharing, especially when you’re handling so much. Building a support network can be crucial—not just for practical help, but emotional support too. Would you be open to exploring some ways to strengthen your support system or even consider community resources?  

Evan: Yeah, I think that could help. Sometimes I feel like I’m just carrying everything alone.  

[11:10] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very common experience among caregivers. Let’s think about some specific people or groups you might reach out to, or even new connections you could make. Also, we might look into local caregiver support groups or online communities. Would that feel manageable for you?  

Evan: Possibly. I’d have to see how I can fit that in. It’s hard to find time, but I know I need to try.  

[11:20] Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely. Making space for support is part of your self-care. Now, considering your work stress, what boundaries have you been able to set around work hours or expectations?  

Evan: Not much, honestly. With all the incidents lately, I’ve been on call pretty much all the time. I feel guilty disconnecting, but I know I need to.  

[11:30] Dr. Bianchi: Guilt can be a powerful barrier. It’s important to remember that setting boundaries isn’t just about protecting your time, but also about maintaining your capacity to be present for your dad and Mira. How might you communicate your limits at work to start creating more space?  

Evan: Maybe I could talk to my manager about setting clearer on-call hours or getting some backup when things get hectic. I haven’t done that yet.  

[11:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a constructive step. Clear communication can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and make your workload more manageable. Would you like to practice how you might approach that conversation?  

Evan: Yeah, I think that would help. I’m worried about sounding like I can’t handle it, but I know I need support.  

[11:50] Dr. Bianchi: We can work on framing that conversation in a way that emphasizes your commitment to quality work while also recognizing your limits. And remember, setting boundaries benefits everyone—you’ll be more effective and less stressed.  

Evan: Thanks, Serena. That makes sense. I’ll try to prepare what I want to say.  

[12:00] Dr. Bianchi: Great. As we wrap up today, let’s identify some actionable steps. You mentioned scheduling a walk, reaching out to support groups, and talking to your manager. How about you also try a brief daily check-in with yourself to track your stress levels and needs?  

Evan: I like that idea. Just a quick note on how I’m feeling. It might help me notice when I need to pause.  

[12:10] Dr. Bianchi: Exactly. Small, consistent steps can lead to meaningful change over time. For next week, let’s focus on implementing at least two of these strategies and observing how they impact your stress. We’ll also explore further how to strengthen your support network.  

Evan: Sounds good. Thanks, Serena. I feel a bit more hopeful knowing there are things I can try.  

[12:20] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that, Evan. Remember, you’re doing a lot with care and responsibility. We’ll keep working together to find sustainable ways to support your well-being. See you next week.  

Evan: Thanks, see you next week.
