**[10:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Good morning, Evan. It’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**[10:02] Evan:** Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and with my dad’s health fluctuating, I’ve felt pretty overwhelmed.  

**[10:05] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with so many responsibilities pressing in on you. Do you want to start by sharing what’s been the most challenging for you this past week?  

**[10:07] Evan:** Well, I guess it’s the balancing act. Juggling my job—especially the on-call stress—and making sure my dad gets the care he needs. Sometimes I feel guilty if I’m not available 24/7.  

**[10:10] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a lot to manage. It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy emotional load, feeling torn between your work responsibilities and your caregiving role. Can you tell me more about how that guilt shows up for you?  

**[10:12] Evan:** Yeah, I guess I feel guilty that I’m not doing enough, even though I know I’m trying my best. When I’m at work, I worry about whether he’s okay, and when I’m with him, I worry about work deadlines. It’s like my mind is always split.  

**[10:15] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That split focus can be draining. It’s like your attention is pulled in two directions all the time. Have you noticed any physical signs or feelings that come up when you’re feeling this way?  

**[10:17] Evan:** I get headaches, and I feel pretty tense—shoulders tight, that kind of thing. Sometimes I just feel exhausted, even when I haven’t done much.  

**[10:20] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Those are important signals from your body that your stress levels are high. It’s good you notice them. Last time, we explored some ways to recognize and name these feelings. How has that been going for you?  

**[10:22] Evan:** It’s helped a little. I’ve been trying to pause and check in with myself more during the day, especially when I notice tension. But honestly, it’s hard to slow down when everything feels urgent.  

**[10:25] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s understandable. When everything feels urgent, slowing down can seem impossible. One thing we can build on is creating small, manageable self-care rituals that fit into your busy schedule. Do you have any ideas or routines you think could work?  

**[10:27] Evan:** Maybe taking a few minutes to breathe or stretch between meetings. I’ve also thought about setting aside some evenings just for myself—like reading or listening to music—but I haven’t made it a regular habit yet.  

**[10:30] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Those sound like promising steps. Even brief moments of breathing or stretching can help reset your stress response. And carving out dedicated time for yourself, even if it’s just once or twice a week, can be very restorative. Would you like to explore scheduling those self-care periods into your week?  

**[10:32] Evan:** Yeah, I think that would help. I tend to get caught up in work or caregiving and forget about myself. Putting it on the calendar might make it more real.  

**[10:35] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Absolutely. Making self-care a scheduled priority helps reinforce its importance. Let’s also think about your support system. Who do you turn to when you need help or someone to talk to?  

**[10:37] Evan:** Well, my wife is supportive, but she’s also busy with her own work. I have a few friends, but I don’t want to burden them too much. Sometimes I feel like I’m carrying this all alone.  

**[10:40] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Feeling isolated can add to the stress. Building a support network that feels reliable and accessible is key. Have you considered joining a caregiver support group or connecting with others in similar situations?  

**[10:42] Evan:** I haven’t looked into support groups yet, but that’s a good idea. It might help to talk with others who understand what I’m going through.  

**[10:45] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That could be very beneficial. Sharing experiences with others can reduce feelings of loneliness and provide practical tips. We can look into local or online groups together if you’d like.  

**[10:47] Evan:** Yes, I’d appreciate that. Also, I want to get better at setting boundaries—like not checking work emails after hours or during nights. I know I should, but I find it hard to disconnect.  

**[10:50] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Boundaries are essential, especially to protect your well-being. Setting clear limits on work time can help create space for rest and family. What might be a first step toward establishing those boundaries?  

**[10:52] Evan:** Maybe turning off email notifications after a certain hour, like 6 or 7 PM. I could also communicate with my team about my availability.  

**[10:55] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s a strong start. Communicating your boundaries helps others respect them. It may also reduce the feeling that you’re always ‘on call,’ which adds to your stress. How do you feel about implementing this starting this week?  

**[10:57] Evan:** I feel motivated to try it. It’s hard to change habits, but I see how it could help.  

**[10:59] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** That’s great. Remember, change takes time, and it’s okay to start small. As we move forward, we’ll continue to build on these steps. Before we wrap up, what’s one thing you want to focus on before our next session?  

**[11:00] Evan:** I want to try scheduling those self-care moments and setting the boundaries for work. Also, I’ll look into a support group for caregivers.  

**[11:02] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** Excellent. We’ll check in on how those steps go and adjust as needed. You’re making meaningful progress, Evan, even amidst these challenges. Keep that in mind.  

**[11:05] Evan:** Thanks, Serena. I appreciate your support. It helps to have a plan and someone to talk to about all this.  

**[11:07] Dr. Serena Bianchi:** You’re very welcome. I look forward to hearing how things go next week. Take care of yourself this week, and remember, small steps can lead to significant change.  

**[11:10] Evan:** Will do. Thanks again. See you next week.
