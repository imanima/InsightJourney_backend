Date: June 04, 2025
Time: 10:00 AM
Client: Evan (Senior DevOps Engineer)
Professional: Dr. Serena Bianchi (Couples & Family Therapist)

[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(Evan shifts in his chair, glancing down briefly)  
Evan: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. Work has been stressful, but I’ve managed to carve out some time for myself, so that’s good.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear you’re making space for yourself, even if things are still challenging. Last time, we discussed some of the stress you’re experiencing from balancing work and caregiving. Have you noticed any changes or new feelings since then?  
(Evan nods, takes a breath)  
Evan: Yeah, I think I’m better at recognizing when I’m starting to feel overwhelmed. I’ve been trying to pause and breathe before jumping into work or worrying about Dad. It’s not perfect, but it helps.  

[10:15] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a valuable skill—pausing and breathing. It’s like creating a buffer between your stress and your response. Can you tell me more about how that’s been working for you?  
Evan: Well, sometimes I catch myself when I’m about to get really anxious during a system outage at work, and I remind myself to take a deep breath. It doesn’t always prevent the stress, but it helps me stay a bit calmer.  

[10:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s excellent progress. It sounds like you’re beginning to build awareness around your stress triggers and responses. Given your role involves a lot of on-call demands, how do you see these moments affecting your overall mental and emotional state?  
(Evan looks thoughtful)  
Evan: Honestly, it’s draining. I love my job, but the constant pressure makes me feel like I’m on edge all the time. And then, with Dad needing more attention, I sometimes feel guilty for not being more present or for wanting a break.  

[10:25] Dr. Bianchi: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Balancing self-care with caregiving and work is a lot for anyone. Let’s explore your support system—who do you usually turn to when you need help or just someone to talk to?  
Evan: Mostly my wife, Clara. She’s been really supportive, but she’s busy with her own work too. I also have a couple of friends from work I vent to sometimes, but I don’t want to burden them too much.  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s good to hear you have Clara and some friends you can lean on. Sometimes, expanding your support network can lighten the load. Have you considered any community resources, like a caregiver support group, or perhaps a therapist for yourself?  
(Evan looks a bit hesitant)  
Evan: I’ve thought about it, but I wasn’t sure if it’s necessary. I don’t want to seem weak or overwhelmed.  

[10:35] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to feel that way, but reaching out for support is actually a sign of strength and self-awareness. Caregiver groups can provide understanding from others in similar situations, and individual therapy can be a safe space to process everything. Would you be open to exploring some options together?  
Evan: Yeah, I think that might help. I do want to handle this better, without just pushing through and ignoring my own needs.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very healthy intention. Let’s also look at some practical self-care strategies. Last time, we discussed scheduling small daily activities—have you been able to set aside time for yourself?  
Evan: I’ve tried. Even just 10 minutes to listen to music or do some stretching helps. I still struggle with guilt when I take that time, but I remind myself that I need it to be better for Dad and work.  

[10:45] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great step—recognizing your needs and giving yourself permission. Guilt often arises from the belief that taking care of ourselves is selfish, but in reality, it’s essential for sustainability. How do you feel about creating a weekly self-care plan that includes specific activities?  
Evan: I like that idea. Maybe I can block some time on weekends for walks or reading. It’s a start.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: Perfect. Having a structured plan can reinforce your boundary-setting and help you feel more in control. As we continue, we’ll also work on communication skills to better express your needs to Clara and others. Do you feel comfortable with that?  
Evan: Yes, I think that’s important. Sometimes I hold back because I don’t want to burden anyone, but I know I need to be honest about my limits.  

[10:55] Dr. Bianchi: Exactly. Honesty and clear boundaries are key to maintaining your well-being and strengthening your relationships. Before we wrap up today, what would you like to focus on for next week?  
Evan: I’d like to work on identifying specific stress triggers and maybe practice some of those communication techniques you mentioned. Also, I want to look into some local support groups or resources.  

[11:00] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a solid plan. I’ll send you some information on caregiver support groups and some exercises for stress and communication. Our next session can focus on implementing those and addressing any challenges.  
(Evan nods, smiling slightly)  
Evan: Thanks, Serena. I appreciate the support.  

[11:05] Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome, Evan. Remember, progress takes time, and each step counts. See you next week.  
(Evan gathers his belongings, stands, and leaves with a more relaxed posture)
