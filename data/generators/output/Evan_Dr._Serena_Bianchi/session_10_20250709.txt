[10:00] Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Evan: Hi, Serena. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and caring for my dad continues to be emotionally draining. But I’m managing—at least most days.  

[10:05] Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a lot to handle all at once. I appreciate you sharing that. Would you like to start by telling me more about how you're feeling today?  

Evan: Yeah, I think I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed, especially with the on-call stresses at work and trying to be present for my dad. Sometimes I feel guilty for not doing more or feeling like I’m falling behind.  

[10:10] Dr. Bianchi: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed given those responsibilities. It sounds like there's a lot of emotional weight on your shoulders. Can you tell me what that guilt feels like in your body or mind?  

Evan: (pauses) It’s like a tight knot in my chest, and my mind keeps racing—thinking I should be doing more, even when I know I’m doing my best. It’s exhausting.  

[10:15] Dr. Bianchi: That knot and the racing thoughts—those are signs of stress and inner conflict. In our previous sessions, we talked about recognizing these feelings early. Have you noticed any moments when you feel more grounded or able to manage those feelings better?  

Evan: Sometimes, when I take a brief walk or step outside for a few minutes, I get a little relief. But honestly, with the constant on-call alerts, it’s hard to find that space for myself.  

[10:20] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a good insight—that brief walk provides some relief. We can build on that. Maybe we can explore creating small, intentional self-care moments throughout your day, even amid the chaos. Would you be open to that?  

Evan: Yeah, I think I need to try that. It’s just hard to find the time when everything feels urgent.  

[10:25] Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely, and that’s a common challenge. Let’s think about some strategic boundaries you can set at work and at home to carve out those moments. For example, perhaps scheduling brief breaks or communicating your needs more clearly. How does that sound?  

Evan: That makes sense. I’ve been hesitant to set boundaries at work because I don’t want to let anyone down, but I realize I need to protect my energy.  

[10:30] Dr. Bianchi: That’s an important realization. Setting boundaries isn’t about letting others down; it’s about maintaining your capacity to be present for both your work and your dad. Let’s also look at your support system—who can you lean on when things feel overwhelming?  

Evan: I have a couple of friends who check in regularly, and my wife is supportive, but I haven’t really asked her for more specific help. I guess I don’t want to burden her too much.  

[10:35] Dr. Bianchi: It’s common to feel that way, but sharing your struggles can strengthen your support network. Sometimes, just letting someone know what you need can make a big difference. Would you feel comfortable having a conversation with your wife about specific ways she can support you?  

Evan: Yeah, I think I should. I’ve been holding a lot in, and it’s probably not fair to her.  

[10:40] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a healthy step. Perhaps you can express your feelings and ask for specific support—like help with daily tasks or just some quiet time for yourself. Moving forward, we can also work on a self-care schedule that fits your busy life. Would you like to try drafting some ideas now?  

Evan: Sure. I think I need concrete plans. I was thinking maybe 10 minutes in the morning for mindfulness or a quick walk during lunch.  

[10:45] Dr. Bianchi: Those are excellent starting points. Small, consistent self-care practices can build resilience over time. Let’s also revisit the family map we created earlier—how’s your relationship with your dad affecting your stress levels?  

Evan: It’s complicated. Seeing him decline due to dementia is heartbreaking. Sometimes, I feel guilty for wanting some space or relief. But I also want to be there for him as best I can.  

[10:50] Dr. Bianchi: That’s a very human response. Acknowledging these conflicting feelings is important. We’ll continue to explore ways to help you manage that emotional load without feeling guilty. Remember, caring for yourself is part of caring for him.  

(Dr. Bianchi glances at the clock)  
[10:55] Dr. Bianchi: We’re nearing the end of our session. To wrap up, what are your main takeaways today?  

Evan: I realize I need to set clearer boundaries at work and ask for more support at home. I also want to try those small self-care practices regularly.  

Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great summary. For next steps, I suggest you discuss your support needs with your wife and experiment with scheduling brief self-care moments. We can also explore any obstacles you encounter next time. How does that sound?  

Evan: Sounds good. Thanks, Serena. I feel a bit more hopeful today.  

Dr. Bianchi: I’m glad to hear that, Evan. Remember, progress is gradual. I’ll see you next week, and in the meantime, take gentle care of yourself.  

Evan: Will do. Thanks again.
