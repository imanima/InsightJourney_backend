**10:00**  
Dr. Bianchi: Good morning, Evan. It's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Evan: Hi, Dr. Bianchi. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been stressful, and caring for my dad is taking a lot out of me. But I guess I’m managing, sort of.  

**10:05**  
Dr. Bianchi: That sounds like a lot to juggle. Would you like to share more about what's been the most challenging for you these days?  
Evan: Well, with my dad’s condition worsening, I feel guilty when I’m at work and can’t be there. Plus, the on-call system at work has me constantly alert. It’s hard to find moments to breathe.  

**10:10**  
Dr. Bianchi: It makes sense that you’re feeling overwhelmed. You’re balancing so many responsibilities. Have you noticed any particular signs of stress—like physical sensations or emotions—that come up most often?  
Evan: Yeah, I get headaches more frequently, and I feel tense all the time. Sometimes, I catch myself snapping at my wife or feeling anxious even when I’m just sitting at my desk.  

**10:15**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s very insightful. Recognizing those signs is a strong first step. Has there been any recent moment where you felt particularly stretched or overwhelmed?  
Evan: Last week, I had a meeting that ran late, and I had to rush home to check on my dad. I was so exhausted that I barely had the energy to listen to my wife when she wanted to talk. I felt guilty afterward.  

**10:20**  
Dr. Bianchi: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of emotional weight, and it’s affecting your interactions and self-care. How do you usually cope when these feelings come up?  
Evan: Honestly, I tend to shut down a bit—try to focus on work or just distract myself with my phone. Sometimes I go for a run, but even that feels like a luxury these days.  

**10:25**  
Dr. Bianchi: Distraction can be a temporary relief, but it sounds like it’s not fully addressing what you’re feeling. Over the past sessions, we’ve talked about building a support network. How has that been going?  
Evan: I’ve reached out to a couple of friends, but I don’t want to burden them with all this. My wife is supportive, but I don’t want to worry her too much either. Sometimes I feel like I don’t have anyone to really talk to.  

**10:30**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s understandable. Sharing these feelings can be tough, especially when you’re worried about being a burden. Remember, vulnerability can strengthen connections. How comfortable do you feel opening up to your wife about your stress?  
Evan: I think I’ve been holding back a bit. I don’t want her to feel overwhelmed, and I guess I don’t want her to see me as weak. But I know I need to be more honest with her.  

**10:35**  
Dr. Bianchi: Honesty can foster closeness, especially when you share your feelings vulnerably. Have you considered ways to communicate your needs without feeling like you’re adding to her worries?  
Evan: Maybe I could tell her I need some quiet time or a break without making it sound like I’m giving up or complaining. Just a way to reset.  

**10:40**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a helpful approach. Setting boundaries for self-care is vital, especially now. Let’s explore some specific self-care strategies you can incorporate. What activities have helped you feel a bit more grounded in the past?  
Evan: Running has helped sometimes, and I’ve also found that journaling briefly in the morning helps me organize my thoughts. But I’ve been inconsistent with both.  

**10:45**  
Dr. Bianchi: Consistency is key, but it’s also important to be gentle with yourself. Perhaps scheduling short, regular moments for these activities could help. Would you be open to creating a simple self-care plan that fits into your busy days?  
Evan: Yeah, I think I could try that. Maybe even just ten minutes in the morning for journaling and a quick walk in the evening.  

**10:50**  
Dr. Bianchi: Excellent. We can develop a flexible plan that feels manageable. Additionally, I’d like us to revisit your support network map from last time. Are there new people you could consider reaching out to, even if it’s just for a quick check-in?  
Evan: I’ve thought about connecting more with my sister. She’s been helpful before, and I think I could ask her for a chat or some advice.  

**11:00**  
Dr. Bianchi: That’s a great idea. Having even one or two trusted people can make a significant difference. Let’s also look at some boundary-setting techniques you can use at work to protect your well-being, especially during on-call periods. How does that sound?  
Evan: That would be helpful. Sometimes I feel obligated to respond immediately, even when I need a break. I think I need to learn how to set limits better.  

**11:05**  
Dr. Bianchi: Absolutely. Communicating your boundaries clearly and assertively can help reduce that pressure. We’ll practice some phrasing for that in future sessions. Before we wrap up today, what’s one small step you feel ready to take before our next meeting?  
Evan: I’ll try to schedule that 10-minute journaling time each morning and reach out to my sister this week.  

**11:10**  
Dr. Bianchi: Those are excellent steps. Remember, small consistent efforts add up over time. Next session, we can check how those practices are working and explore further ways to support your stress management. Would you like to focus on anything specific next time?  
Evan: Maybe I’d like to dive deeper into managing on-call stress and how to communicate my needs at work better.  

**11:15**  
Dr. Bianchi: Perfect. That’s a good plan. Thank you for being open today, Evan. You’re making meaningful progress, even when it doesn’t always feel that way. Take care of yourself this week.  
Evan: Thanks, Dr. Bianchi. I appreciate your support.  

**11:20**  
Dr. Bianchi: You’re very welcome. I look forward to hearing how your new routines go. Have a good week.  
Evan: You too. Bye.
