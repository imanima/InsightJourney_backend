**[10:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
Good morning, Evan. It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?  

**[10:02] Evan:**  
Hi, Serena. Honestly, a bit overwhelmed. The stress from work and caring for my dad has been piling up. I’ve been trying to stay organized, but it’s hard to switch off.  

**[10:04] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
That sounds exhausting. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed given everything you’re juggling. Last time, we talked about setting some boundaries at work—how has that been going?  

**[10:06] Evan:**  
I’ve tried to be more intentional about my on-call hours, but there have been a few emergencies that pulled me back in. Still, I’m making an effort to disconnect after hours. I also started a support group for caregivers, which helps a bit.  

**[10:08] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
That’s a strong step—building a support network can really buffer stress. How do you feel about your current support system overall?  

**[10:10] Evan:**  
It’s growing, but I realize I still lean heavily on my wife and a few close friends. Sometimes I don’t want to burden them too much. I keep a lot inside.  

**[10:12] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
That inner tendency to hold things in can increase emotional strain. Let’s explore that a bit. When you notice yourself holding back, what feelings come up?  

**[10:15] Evan:**  
Usually guilt or shame, like I shouldn’t be complaining when my dad’s situation is so serious. Also, I feel guilty taking time for myself.  

**[10:17] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
Those feelings are very common in caregivers—feeling guilty about prioritizing self-care or asking for support. Can you recall a recent moment when you felt that way?  

**[10:20] Evan:**  
Yeah, last weekend I tried to take an hour to go for a run, but I kept thinking about what I should be doing at home or at work. I felt like I was neglecting everything.  

**[10:22] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
That’s a classic example—the mind racing with responsibilities. Let’s try a quick exercise. Imagine the guilt and stress as a color or shape. What do they look like for you?  

**[10:25] Evan:**  
Hmm, I’d say dark gray, heavy, like a cloud hanging over me.  

**[10:27] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
That’s a powerful image. When you notice that cloud, what might help to lighten it? Small actions, thoughts, or even physical movements?  

**[10:30] Evan:**  
Maybe taking a deep breath or reminding myself that I need to care for myself, too. But honestly, sometimes that feels like just another thing to add to my list.  

**[10:33] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
It’s understandable to feel that way. Self-care can sometimes seem like one more task, but we can work on making it more integrated and less burdensome. Would it help to have a simple, consistent self-care routine that fits into your day?  

**[10:35] Evan:**  
Possibly. I’ve been thinking about trying to set aside 10 minutes in the morning for mindfulness or just some quiet time. But I haven’t committed to it yet.  

**[10:38] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
That’s a great start—small, manageable, and achievable. Perhaps we could develop a specific plan for your mornings? Something you can look forward to without feeling overwhelmed?  

**[10:40] Evan:**  
Yeah, I think I could try that. Maybe just breathing exercises or listening to some calming music before starting work.  

**[10:43] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
Excellent. Incorporating a brief ritual can create a sense of grounding. Also, I’d like us to explore your work-life balance further. You mentioned trying to disconnect after hours—what else might help you feel more in control?  

**[10:45] Evan:**  
I’ve been considering creating a more structured schedule at work, setting clear boundaries around project deadlines. But the nature of my role is unpredictable sometimes.  

**[10:48] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
Unpredictability is tough, especially when you’re managing so many responsibilities. Still, establishing some routines or buffers could help. How about using a shared calendar to block out time for work tasks, caregiving, and self-care?  

**[10:50] Evan:**  
That’s a good idea. It might help me see where I can carve out space for myself without feeling guilty.  

**[10:52] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
Exactly. Visual tools like calendars can make boundaries more concrete. And remember, it’s okay to ask for flexibility when needed. As we’ve discussed before, your needs matter just as much as everything else.  

**[10:55] Evan:**  
Thanks, Serena. I appreciate that reminder. I do feel like I’m making some progress, even if it’s slow.  

**[10:57] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
You’re doing important work, Evan. Progress often comes gradually, especially with complex challenges like yours. Before we wrap up, what’s one small action you’ll commit to before our next session?  

**[10:59] Evan:**  
I’ll start using a calendar to block out my time and try that morning mindfulness for at least three days.  

**[11:00] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
That sounds like a solid plan. I’ll look forward to hearing how it goes next week. Keep in mind, self-compassion is key—be gentle with yourself as you try these new approaches.  

**[11:02] Evan:**  
Thanks, Serena. I really appreciate your support.  

**[11:03] Dr. Serena Bianchi:**  
You’re very welcome. Take care this week, and remember, small steps lead to meaningful change. See you next time.  

**[11:05] End of session.**
