Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How’s your week been since our last session? Any wins or surprises?

[02:02] Lina: Hey, Riley. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit up and down. I did manage to stick to my schedule a couple of days, but then I got overwhelmed with a couple of projects, and everything kind of fell apart again.

[02:05] Riley: That’s pretty common, especially with the busy freelance life. Let’s celebrate the days you kept your schedule—that’s progress! What do you think made those days work better?

[02:07] Lina: Hmm, I think I just committed to blocking out specific times for tasks. I used my Notion calendar more intentionally, and I set reminders for breaks.

[02:10] Riley: Nice! So, it sounds like the external reminders and time blocking are starting to click. How did it feel to have those cues guiding you?

[02:12] Lina: It was helpful, honestly. I felt less anxious about forgetting tasks or losing focus. But then, I hit a point where I’d get distracted or overwhelmed, and I’d abandon the plan.

[02:15] Riley: That’s a common pattern. The key is to build those routines so they become more automatic over time. Let’s try to identify what triggers those overwhelm moments. Were there specific tasks or times of day where you felt the shift?

[02:17] Lina: Usually in the late afternoon. I think my energy dips, and I start feeling anxious about all the stuff I still need to do.

[02:20] Riley: Great insight. So, energy dips and anxiety seem linked. Have you noticed any ways to manage that energy slump—like brief energizing breaks or adjusting your workload?

[02:22] Lina: Not consistently. I’ve tried a few quick stretches or a short walk, but I forget to do it regularly. I guess I need a more structured approach.

[02:25] Riley: Absolutely. This is where our energy regulation techniques come into play. How about creating a mini “energy check-in” routine? Like, every hour, you pause for 2 minutes, assess your energy, and do a quick activity—stretch, breathe, or move. Would that fit into your workflow?

[02:27] Lina: Yeah, I think I could do that. It sounds manageable. I like the idea of mini check-ins rather than big breaks.

[02:30] Riley: Perfect. Let’s also revisit your task chunking. Last time, you mentioned breaking projects into smaller pieces. How’s that been going?

[02:32] Lina: I’ve tried, but sometimes I get stuck trying to figure out the perfect way to chunk tasks, so I end up overthinking, or I just avoid starting altogether.

[02:35] Riley: That’s totally normal. Remember, the goal is to create “good enough” chunks, not perfect ones. Think of it like building a game—each level doesn’t have to be flawless, just playable. How about we set a rule: for each task, you create the first rough chunk, and you can refine it later if needed?

[02:37] Lina: I like that. Just get started, then improve later. That takes the pressure off.

[02:40] Riley: Exactly. And I see you’re already making good progress with your external cues. Now, about your project deadlines—how are you tracking those?

[02:42] Lina: Honestly, I’ve been a bit reactive. I juggle multiple projects, and I tend to leave the big deadlines until the last minute, which causes stress.

[02:45] Riley: That’s a common challenge. To shift from reactive to proactive, I recommend setting up a visual project timeline—like a Kanban board—so you can see upcoming deadlines clearly and plan backwards from them.

[02:47] Lina: I like that idea. I’ve been meaning to try a Kanban board, but I haven’t set it up yet.

[02:50] Riley: Then let’s prioritize that as a next step. I can send you a simple Notion template for a Kanban board tailored for your projects. How does that sound?

[02:52] Lina: Perfect. That’ll help me visualize and stay ahead of deadlines.

[02:55] Riley: Great. To wrap up, let’s set some action items for the week: First, implement your energy check-ins hourly. Second, create a rough task chunk for your next big project. And third, set up your Kanban board for upcoming deadlines.

[02:57] Lina: Sounds doable. I’ll give it a try.

[02:59] Riley: Awesome. And next session, we’ll review how those went and look at any adjustments needed. How are you feeling about the plan?

[03:00] Lina: Good. I feel more organized just talking about it. Thanks, Riley.

[03:02] Riley: My pleasure! Remember, progress is a journey—celebrate each step. See you next week!
