Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How’s your week been since our last session? Any wins or surprises?

[02:03] Lina: Hey Riley! Yeah, it’s been a mix. I did manage to stick to my morning routine a few days, which felt really good. But I also got overwhelmed with a couple of project deadlines—kind of hit that task paralysis again.

[02:06] Riley: Ah, that’s a common pattern—congratulations on the mornings that went well, though! Let’s celebrate those wins. So, when deadlines sneak up, what do you notice happening? Are you avoiding the tasks, or just feeling stuck?

[02:09] Lina: It’s mostly feeling stuck. I open my project files and then just stare at the screen, unsure where to start. I think I get overwhelmed by the size of the task.

[02:12] Riley: That’s classic task paralysis. So, let’s try breaking down those big projects into smaller, bite-sized chunks. Remember how we talked about "task chunking"? How about we pick one project now—say, the current client feature—and create a mini plan?

[02:15] Lina: Yeah, I like that. I think I could do a list of smaller steps, like "draft outline," "code first part," "test." But sometimes, I forget to look at that list when I get overwhelmed.

[02:18] Riley: That’s where external reminders come in. Do you want to set up a visual checklist in Notion that you can see every day? Or maybe a notification system that nudges you when it’s time to work on those chunks?

[02:21] Lina: I could do that. I have Notion, so I can make a checklist there. Maybe even set a recurring reminder.

[02:24] Riley: Perfect. And when you’re staring at the screen feeling stuck, what if you practice a quick “5-minute rule”—just commit to working on one tiny step for five minutes? Often, starting is the hardest part.

[02:27] Lina: Yeah, that sounds doable. I think I often hesitate because I think I need to do everything at once. Breaking it down like that might help.

[02:30] Riley: Exactly. It’s about reducing that initial overwhelm. Now, how’s your energy level today? Do you feel alert enough to tackle some of those chunks now?

[02:33] Lina: Honestly, I’m a bit tired, but I do have a fresh cup of coffee. I think I can get started on that outline.

[02:36] Riley: Great! Let’s set a small goal for the next 15 minutes. Maybe just brainstorm the outline or write a rough draft? That way, you’re making progress without feeling pressured.

[02:39] Lina: Sounds good. I’ll do that. (starts typing)

[02:42] Riley: Awesome. While you do that, I want to check in on your time management. Have you experimented with time blocking your work hours? How’s that been going?

[02:45] Lina: Yeah, I tried blocking mornings for deep work, but sometimes I get sidetracked with emails or quick fixes. I think I need to stick more strictly to the blocks.

[02:48] Riley: That’s a common challenge. One trick is to set external alarms or timers—like Pomodoro timers—that signal when your deep work session starts and ends. Have you tried that?

[02:51] Lina: Not really, but I could try using a timer app. I think it would help me stay focused during those blocks.

[02:54] Riley: Excellent. And remember, it’s about consistency over perfection. If you slip once, just reset and try again. Also, how do you feel about tracking your energy levels throughout the day? That can help you identify your most productive times.

[02:57] Lina: Hmm, I haven’t done that systematically, but I notice I work better in the late mornings and early afternoons.

[03:00] Riley: Perfect. Maybe you can plan your most demanding tasks during those windows. Now, about your weekly planning—have you been reviewing your task lists and adjusting your priorities?

[03:03] Lina: I’ve been a bit inconsistent with that. Sometimes I forget to revisit my Notion planner until I’m already behind.

[03:06] Riley: Let’s incorporate a weekly review ritual—say, every Sunday evening or Monday morning—that’s non-negotiable. During that time, you can review your progress, adjust your priorities, and set clear goals for the week.

[03:09] Lina: I like that. I think making it a routine would help me stay more organized and reduce that last-minute scramble.

[03:12] Riley: Exactly. Consistency builds momentum. Now, looking back at our previous sessions, we’ve worked on creating routines and using external tools. How are those strategies holding up?

[03:15] Lina: The routines are better, especially my morning start, but I still slip into procrastination mode sometimes. The tools help, but I need to be more disciplined about checking them regularly.

[03:18] Riley: That’s a common phase—tools are great, but habit formation takes time. How about adding a quick "check-in" step, like a 2-minute review when you start your workday? Just to look at your task list and remind yourself of your goals.

[03:21] Lina: That could work. I can set a recurring alarm for that.

[03:24] Riley: Perfect. So, to summarize, your action items are: 1) Create and set external reminders for your project chunks in Notion, 2) Use a timer during your deep work blocks, 3) Implement a weekly review ritual, and 4) Add a quick morning check-in.

[03:27] Lina: Got it. That sounds manageable. Thanks, Riley.

[03:30] Riley: You’re doing great, Lina. Remember, progress is about small, consistent steps. I’ll see you next week, and we can review how these new routines are working.

[03:33] Lina: Looking forward to it! Thanks again.

[03:36] Riley: Take care, Lina. Have a productive week!
