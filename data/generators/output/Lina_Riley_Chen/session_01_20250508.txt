Session 1/24
Date: May 08, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last chat? (smiles warmly)

[02:05] Lina: Hey Riley! Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I’m super focused, other days I get overwhelmed just thinking about starting projects. But I did try your suggestion of breaking down tasks last week, so that’s a win.

[02:10] Riley: That’s fantastic! Breaking tasks into smaller chunks can really help with that feeling of overwhelm. Can you tell me more about how you approached it? Did you pick a specific project?

[02:15] Lina: Yeah, I was working on a client website update. I divided the work into sections—like design tweaks, code fixes, testing—and then broke those down into smaller steps. It felt manageable, but I still struggled to stick to the schedule sometimes.

[02:20] Riley: That’s a common experience, Lina. The fact that you’re trying different strategies shows great momentum. Did you notice any particular times of day when you felt more focused or more prone to distraction?

(leans forward slightly, attentive)

[02:25] Lina: I think mornings are better for me. I tend to get distracted more in the afternoons, especially when I haven’t set clear boundaries for breaks.

[02:30] Riley: That’s an important insight. So, perhaps structuring your mornings with dedicated work blocks might boost your productivity? I’d suggest experimenting with time blocking—maybe a focused session first thing, then scheduled breaks.

(uses playful tone) And maybe even turning breaks into mini reward stations? Like a quick walk, some stretching, or a fun snack?

[02:35] Lina: I like that idea. I do have a bad habit of skipping breaks or just scrolling endlessly. Having scheduled breaks might help me reset.

[02:40] Riley: Exactly. External reminders can be your allies here. Do you want to try setting an alarm or a timer during our next session to signal start and end times for work blocks?

(enthusiastic) It’s like creating your own game level—beat the timer, earn the satisfaction!

[02:45] Lina: Haha, I love that gamified approach. It makes it seem less like work and more like a challenge.

(voice softens) Sometimes I feel like I get stuck in task paralysis, especially when I see a big project looming. I freeze up instead of starting.

[02:50] Riley: That’s a classic challenge with ADHD—task paralysis. One effective technique is to focus on just the first step. Like, “I’ll open the file” or “write one line of code.” Often, starting is the hardest part, but once you begin, momentum follows.

(leans back thoughtfully) And I remember you mentioning that you’re more creative during certain times. Do you think aligning your most demanding tasks with those times might help?

[02:55] Lina: Yeah, I think I’m more creative in the late mornings, so I could try tackling the trickier parts then. The afternoons I could reserve for lighter tasks or admin stuff.

(looks more energized) That could make my day feel less chaotic.

[03:00] Riley: Perfect. And to keep track of your progress, I’ll send you a simple notion template that allows you to mark completed chunks and see your streaks. Visual progress can be motivating, especially when managing ADHD.

(voice encouraging) How does that sound?

[03:05] Lina: That sounds really helpful. I think seeing my progress will motivate me to keep going. Sometimes I get discouraged when I see a long to-do list.

[03:10] Riley: That’s totally understandable. Celebrating small wins is key. Perhaps we can set up a habit tracker for you, so each time you complete a chunk, you get a little “win” badge or score.

(plays playfully) Imagine earning points for each completed task—like a game!

[03:15] Lina: Haha, I’d be competitive with myself. I like that. It makes it feel less like a chore.

(soft smile) Overall, I want to get better at planning my day so I don’t feel so scattered.

[03:20] Riley: That’s a great focus. Building a consistent routine around your most productive times, with clear task chunks and scheduled breaks, will help reduce that overwhelm. Over the next few weeks, we can track how these strategies are working and adjust.

(leans in slightly) And remember, progress isn’t always linear—some days will be better than others, and that’s okay.

[03:25] Lina: Thanks, Riley. I appreciate your support. I already feel a bit more hopeful just having some concrete ideas.

[03:30] Riley: That’s wonderful to hear. Before we wrap up, let’s set some action items for you: First, try implementing a morning time block for your most challenging tasks, using external reminders. Second, set up a simple habit tracker in Notion to celebrate your wins. And third, keep noting your focus times and energy levels to refine your schedule.

(cheerfully) And I’ll send you some templates and a quick guide to get started.

[03:35] Lina: Sounds perfect. I’ll get to work on that this week. Thanks again, Riley.

[03:40] Riley: My pleasure, Lina. Looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. Remember, small steps lead to big changes! Have a great rest of your day.

(voice warm) See you in our next session!
