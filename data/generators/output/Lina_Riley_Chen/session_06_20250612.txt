Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Glad you could make it today. How’s everything been since our last session? Any wins or surprises?

[02:05] Lina: Hey Riley! Yeah, actually, I’ve been trying to implement some of the routines we discussed. I managed to stick to my morning planning for three days straight, which is a first for me. Feels kind of good, but also a bit shaky.

[02:10] Riley: That’s fantastic! Three days in a row is a solid start, Lina. What do you think helped you stay consistent those mornings? Was there a particular change or addition?

[02:10] Lina: I think using my Notion template more intentionally made a difference. I set a specific morning checklist with small tasks—like reviewing my day’s priorities and doing a quick stretch. It kind of made the whole process less overwhelming.

[02:15] Riley: Love that! The structure and chunking your routine into manageable steps is exactly the kind of external support that helps with ADHD tendencies. Did you notice any difference in how you felt during the day after those mornings?

[02:20] Lina: Yeah, I felt a bit more organized, less frantic. But I still struggle mid-day, especially with starting new tasks or switching between projects. It’s like I get stuck in task paralysis sometimes.

[02:20] Riley: That’s a common challenge, especially with ADHD—getting stuck before even starting. Have you tried using external reminders or timers to push through those moments?

[02:25] Lina: I’ve set timers before, but I often ignore them or forget to check back. I think I need a more consistent system for that.

[02:25] Riley: Absolutely, consistency is key. How about integrating a visual cue on your workspace—like a small sign or an app notification—that signals “time to switch tasks”? Sometimes, a tactile or visual reminder can make a difference.

[02:30] Lina: That might work. I could put a sticky note on my monitor or set a recurring alarm. I like the idea of making it more unavoidable, in a good way.

[02:30] Riley: Great! Now, thinking about your project deadlines—how are you feeling about managing those? Any recent stress points?

[02:35] Lina: Honestly, I’ve been procrastinating on some big features. I keep telling myself I’ll start tomorrow, but tomorrow keeps moving further away. I think I need to break those big tasks into smaller chunks.

[02:35] Riley: That’s a smart move. Chunking big projects into smaller, actionable steps can reduce overwhelm and help you build momentum. Have you tried using your AI Kanban board for these big features?

[02:40] Lina: A little, but I think I need to be more disciplined about updating it regularly. Sometimes I forget or ignore it when I’m in the middle of something.

[02:40] Riley: Maybe you could set a dedicated “review and plan” time daily—say, 10 minutes at the end of your workday—to update your Kanban. Making it a routine could help reinforce it.

[02:45] Lina: Yeah, I can see that working. It’s just hard to stick to routines when my energy fluctuates so much during the day.

[02:45] Riley: That’s totally normal. Have you considered aligning your toughest tasks with your peak energy times? For example, if you notice you’re more focused in the late morning, schedule your most demanding work then.

[02:50] Lina: I think I do better early afternoon, but I tend to crash later. I haven’t been tracking my energy levels systematically, though.

[02:50] Riley: Let’s try that next. Keep a simple daily log of your energy highs and lows—maybe using a quick Notion form or even a color-coded chart. Over time, we can optimize your schedule around those patterns.

[02:55] Lina: That sounds helpful. I want to get better at managing my focus and energy without feeling like I’m fighting myself all the time.

[02:55] Riley: Exactly. The goal is to build a flexible system that works with your natural rhythms, not against them. Now, reflecting on our sessions so far, what’s felt most useful or encouraging?

[03:00] Lina: I think the habit tracking and the visual reminders have made a real difference. Also, knowing I have a plan for my big projects makes them less intimidating.

[03:00] Riley: That’s wonderful to hear. Progress is always a journey, and you’re making steady strides. For next time, let’s focus on refining your energy tracking and experimenting with scheduling your high-focus tasks. How does that sound?

[03:05] Lina: Perfect. Thanks, Riley. I’m feeling more motivated to keep experimenting.

[03:05] Riley: Great! I’ll send you a simple energy tracking template before our next session. And remember, celebrate every small win—those are the building blocks of lasting change. See you next week, Lina!

[03:10] Lina: Thanks so much. See you then!
