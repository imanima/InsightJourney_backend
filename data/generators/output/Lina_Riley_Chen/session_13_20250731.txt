Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any wins or surprises this week?

[02:05] Lina: Hey Riley! Thanks. Yeah, I actually managed to stick to a morning routine most days, which felt awesome. I think the habit tracker helped a lot. But I still struggle with finishing longer projects—like that client website I was working on.

[02:10] Riley: That’s fantastic progress on the routine—small wins matter! And it’s normal to hit bumps with bigger projects. Tell me more about what happens when you get stuck on those. Do you notice a pattern?

[02:12] Lina: Yeah, I think I get overwhelmed just thinking about the scope. I procrastinate, then feel guilty because I’m not progressing, which just makes it worse.

[02:15] Riley: That’s classic task paralysis. It’s great you’re aware of it. Have you tried breaking down these large projects into smaller, more manageable chunks before?

[02:17] Lina: Not consistently. Sometimes I do, but then I forget to review those smaller steps or I don’t stick to the plan.

[02:20] Riley: That’s where external reminders and a structured system can really help. Remember, last time we discussed using Notion templates for breaking down tasks? How’s that been going?

[02:22] Lina: I started using the template, but I still don’t review it regularly. I get distracted or sidetracked with other small tasks.

[02:25] Riley: Okay, so maybe we can set up a dedicated weekly review ritual—say, every Monday morning—to go over your project breakdowns? A fixed time can turn into a cue for the reviewing habit.

[02:27] Lina: That sounds good. I think if I schedule it, I’ll be more consistent.

[02:30] Riley: Perfect. Let’s also look at your energy levels. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed, but do you notice times of day when you’re more focused or energized?

[02:32] Lina: Usually mid-morning. After my coffee, I feel more alert. But in the late afternoon, I get sluggish.

[02:35] Riley: Great insight. We can leverage that by scheduling your most demanding tasks during your peak energy times. Have you tried blocking out time for deep work?

[02:37] Lina: Not systematically. I tend to just work whenever I feel like it, which isn’t always the best.

[02:40] Riley: Time blocking can turn your natural rhythms into a superpower. Let’s set up a weekly schedule with specific blocks for deep work, breaks, and admin tasks. How does that sound?

[02:42] Lina: I like the idea. I think it’ll help me stay on track and avoid the task paralysis.

[02:45] Riley: Excellent. And as a quick check-in, how are your energy regulation strategies? Are you incorporating anything like movement or mini-breaks?

[02:47] Lina: Not really. I tend to work straight through until I burn out, then crash.

[02:50] Riley: That’s a common pattern. Let’s add some scheduled movement breaks—maybe five-minute stretches or quick walks every hour. These can boost your focus and energy.

[02:52] Lina: I can try that. It sounds doable.

[02:55] Riley: Awesome. So, to summarize today’s plan: establish a weekly review session for project breakdowns, implement time blocking aligned with your energy peaks, and set short movement breaks during work sessions. How does that feel?

[02:57] Lina: Really good. I feel more confident about tackling my projects now.

[02:59] Riley: Glad to hear! Before we wrap up, do you want to set a mini-goal for next week?

[03:00] Lina: Yeah, I’ll set up my Notion project templates, create a weekly schedule with time blocks, and schedule my first review session for Monday morning.

[03:02] Riley: Perfect. And I’ll send you a quick reminder and some resources on effective time blocking and movement breaks. Keep celebrating those small wins, Lina. You're making great progress.

[03:05] Lina: Thanks, Riley. I appreciate the support. See you next week!

[03:07] Riley: Looking forward to it. Have a productive week!
