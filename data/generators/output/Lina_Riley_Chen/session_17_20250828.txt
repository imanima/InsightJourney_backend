Session 17/24
Date: August 28, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How are you feeling today? Any highlights or challenges since our last session?

[02:05] Lina: Hey Riley! Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with a couple of projects piling up. I did manage to finish a client quick fix yesterday, so that was a win. But then today, I got stuck just trying to decide where to start on the bigger project. It’s like paralysis sets in sometimes.

[02:10] Riley: Ah, task paralysis—the classic! It sounds like your wins help, but the bigger projects still feel a bit daunting. Do you remember last time we talked about breaking tasks into smaller chunks? How’s that been going?

[02:15] Lina: Yeah, I’ve tried chunking some tasks, especially with the smaller ones. Like, I broke down the quick fix into three steps. But for the big project, I still struggle to even define the chunks. I get overwhelmed just thinking about the whole thing.

[02:20] Riley: That’s totally normal. Sometimes the big picture can be intimidating. Let’s try a different approach today—what if we looked at the first concrete step you can take right now? Not the whole project, just the very first action.

[02:25] Lina: Hmm, maybe I could start by outlining the main features I want to implement. I keep delaying that, though, because I feel like I need a perfect plan before I even start.

[02:30] Riley: That’s a common trap—getting stuck in planning! Remember, a rough outline is enough to get you moving. Think of it as your first “level” in a game—you don’t need the entire map, just enough to start exploring. How about jotting down three main features you want to include? Would that feel doable?

[02:35] Lina: Yeah, I can do that. I have some ideas, so I’ll try to sketch that out and see where it leads.

[02:40] Riley: Excellent! That’s a perfect first step. And for today, let’s also talk about your schedule—how are your routines around starting work? Any patterns or cues that help you get into “work mode”?

[02:45] Lina: Not really. I tend to sit down and then get distracted trying to find the next thing to do. Sometimes I start checking emails or social media instead.

[02:50] Riley: That’s a common distraction. What if we set up a simple routine—say, a specific time to start work, plus a visual cue like opening your task app or a designated workspace? Have you tried any external reminders or triggers before?

[02:55] Lina: Not consistently. I think I could set a calendar reminder or maybe put a sticky note on my monitor.

[02:00] Riley: Perfect. Let’s choose one now—maybe a sticky note that says “Start your project outline” or a calendar alert. Which feels more reliable for you?

[02:05] Lina: I think the sticky note might be easier—I’ll stick it on my monitor. I like the visual cue idea.

[02:10] Riley: Great! Visual cues can be very powerful, especially when you’re prone to distraction. Now, last time we also talked about tracking your progress. How has that been going? Are you using your habit dashboard or any other system?

[02:15] Lina: I've been trying to keep a habit tracker in Notion, but honestly, I forget to update it sometimes. So it’s not super consistent.

[02:20] Riley: That’s okay—building consistency takes time. Maybe we can set a quick, daily routine—like at the end of each work session, you spend two minutes updating your tracker. Also, I’d love to hear if seeing your progress motivates you.

[02:25] Lina: Yeah, I think I can do that. If I keep it simple and quick, it might become a habit. Plus, seeing even small wins could boost my motivation.

[02:30] Riley: Exactly! Small, frequent updates can create a positive feedback loop. Now, thinking ahead, over these next few weeks, how would you like to measure your progress on creating more consistent routines?

[02:35] Lina: Maybe I could set a goal to start my work routine at the same time each day—say, 10 AM—and track how often I stick to that.

[02:40] Riley: That’s a solid goal. Consistency at a specific time can help build a habit. Would you like to set a mini challenge—say, aiming for five out of seven days this week to start at 10 AM?

[02:45] Lina: Yeah, I like that. I think I can do five days. It’s realistic.

[02:50] Riley: Awesome! And I’ll help you with accountability—maybe we can check in on your progress in our next session. Before we wrap up today, do you want to reflect on any particular feelings or insights about what we discussed?

[02:55] Lina: I feel a bit more hopeful about tackling the big project now. Breaking it down into just a couple of steps seems manageable. Also, setting visual cues and tracking progress feels doable.

[03:00] Riley: That’s wonderful, Lina. Remember, progress is about small, steady steps. You’re doing great. For next week, your action items are: outline three features for your project, set up your sticky note cue, and aim for five days of starting work at 10 AM. Sound good?

[03:05] Lina: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thanks, Riley. Looking forward to next week!

[03:10] Riley: Me too! Keep celebrating those wins, no matter how small. See you next week!
