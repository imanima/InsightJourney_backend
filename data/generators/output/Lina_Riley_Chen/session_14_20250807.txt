[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any wins or challenges you'd like to start with today?  

[02:05] Lina: Hey Riley! Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I tried to stick to the new routine we set up last week, but I keep getting stuck on certain tasks, especially when I hit a big project deadline.  

[02:07] Riley: That’s totally normal, especially with big projects looming. Remember, progress isn’t always linear. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening when you get stuck?  

[02:10] Lina: Well, I think I’m having trouble breaking down tasks into manageable chunks. I see the big picture and feel overwhelmed, so I freeze up. Sometimes I just end up procrastinating or wasting time on less important things.  

[02:12] Riley: Got it. That task paralysis is a common challenge. Let’s revisit the task chunking technique we discussed. Do you recall how we designed your system to break projects into smaller, actionable steps?  

[02:15] Lina: Yeah, I remember. But I think I need a more concrete way to apply it. Like, I get the concept, but in practice, I struggle to decide what the first step should be.  

[02:18] Riley: That’s a great insight. Sometimes the hardest part is identifying that initial “micro-task.” Let’s try a quick exercise now. Can you tell me about your current big project? We’ll work together to break it down.  

[02:20] Lina: Sure. I’m working on a new website for a client, and it’s due in three weeks. There are design, content, and development parts.  

[02:23] Riley: Perfect. Let’s start with the design component. What’s the very first thing you need to do to start that?  

[02:25] Lina: I guess I need to gather inspiration and create a mood board.  

[02:27] Riley: Excellent. So, that’s your first micro-task. How about content? What’s the initial step there?  

[02:29] Lina: Outlining the main pages and the key messages for each.  

[02:31] Riley: Great. Now, for development, what’s the first actionable step?  

[02:33] Lina: Setting up the development environment and creating a basic skeleton structure in code.  

[02:36] Riley: Awesome. You see how breaking it down makes it less intimidating? And now, each of these micro-tasks can be scheduled separately. Do you want to try scheduling these in your Notion template later?  

[02:38] Lina: Yeah, I think that would help me stay focused. Sometimes I forget what I was supposed to do next.  

[02:40] Riley: That’s where external reminders and a simple checklist can make a big difference. How have your time blocking efforts been going?  

[02:45] Lina: Honestly, I’ve been trying, but I keep getting sidetracked or losing track of time. I think I need better boundaries or more realistic blocks.  

[02:47] Riley: That’s a common challenge. Let’s look at your current schedule. Do you have specific blocks for deep work, and are they aligned with when you feel most energized?  

[02:50] Lina: I tend to work late at night, but I’ve noticed I’m more focused in the mornings. Maybe I should shift my deep work to the mornings.  

[02:52] Riley: That’s a smart move. Working with your energy levels can boost focus and productivity. Would you like to set a goal for this week to do at least two mornings with dedicated deep work sessions?  

[02:55] Lina: Yeah, I’d like that. It feels more manageable than trying to overhaul my entire schedule at once.  

[02:57] Riley: Perfect. We can also incorporate some energy regulation techniques, like quick movement breaks or mindful breathing, to keep your focus sharp during those sessions.  

[03:00] Lina: I like that idea. Sometimes I forget to take breaks, and I just burn out.  

[03:03] Riley: That’s very common. Remember, brief, intentional breaks actually enhance productivity. Let’s plan for a 5-minute movement or mindfulness break every 25 minutes during your deep work.  

[03:05] Lina: Sounds good. I’ll try that. Also, I’ve been noticing some difficulty with starting tasks, especially when I feel tired. Any tips?  

[03:08] Riley: Absolutely. One approach is to use external cues—like setting a timer or using a prompt—so that once it goes off, you commit to starting that micro-task. Also, creating a ritual, like a specific workspace setup or a 2-minute prep routine, can signal it’s time to begin.  

[03:10] Lina: That makes sense. Like a mental switch. I’ll try setting a timer on my phone.  

[03:12] Riley: Great idea. And over time, these cues become anchors that help reduce task initiation hesitation. Before we wrap up, let’s review your action plan for next week.  

[03:15] Lina: Okay. I’ll break down my current projects into micro-tasks, schedule at least two deep work blocks in the mornings, and use timers to start tasks.  

[03:17] Riley: Excellent. And remember to track your progress in Notion and reflect on what’s working during your weekly review. How does that sound?  

[03:20] Lina: It sounds doable. I already feel a bit more organized just talking through it.  

[03:22] Riley: That’s the power of clarity. Before we finish, any questions or thoughts?  

[03:25] Lina: No, I think I just need to stay consistent and be patient with myself.  

[03:27] Riley: Perfect mindset. Progress takes time, and each small step counts. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll review how the new routines are going.  

[03:30] Lina: Thanks, Riley. This was really helpful.  

[03:32] Riley: You’re welcome! Have a great week, Lina—stay energized and keep those micro-tasks in check!
