Session 12/24
Date: July 24, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hey Lina! Great to see you again. How’s your week been? Any wins or surprises since our last session?

[Lina]: Hey Riley! Thanks. Actually, I managed to stick to my new morning routine for three days straight, which felt amazing. But yesterday, I hit a wall with a big deadline and kind of froze up. So, mixed feelings, I guess.

[02:05] Riley: That’s a fantastic start—three days in a row! Celebrate those wins. And it’s totally normal to hit a bump, especially with big deadlines looming. Let’s unpack that a bit. When you say you froze, what exactly happened? Were you overwhelmed, distracted, or something else?

[Lina]: It was probably a mix. I had a long list of tasks, but I couldn’t decide what to do first. My mind kept jumping around, and I started feeling anxious, so I ended up procrastinating a lot.

[02:10] Riley: Sounds like task paralysis, which is common when the list feels overwhelming. Have you tried any specific strategies to break down big projects into more manageable chunks? Maybe a way to visualize the steps?

[Lina]: Not really. I usually just write everything down, but I don’t always break it into smaller parts. Sometimes I just stare at the list and feel stuck.

[02:15] Riley: That makes sense. One thing we can experiment with is “task chunking.” For example, if a project is to build a website, we could define chunks like “draft layout,” “write content,” “code homepage,” etc. How does that sound?

[Lina]: I like that. It feels less intimidating when I see smaller steps. I think I’ve been trying to do everything at once, which just makes me freeze.

[02:20] Riley: Perfect. And I also want to revisit your time blocking. During our last sessions, we set up blocks for focused work and breaks, right? How’s that been going?

[Lina]: Honestly, I’ve been better at sticking to the blocks, especially in the mornings. But in the afternoons, I still drift and get distracted easily, especially when I don’t have a clear plan.

[02:25] Riley: That’s progress! Afternoon focus can be tricky. Sometimes, adding external reminders—like alarms or notifications—can help reinforce the schedule. Have you tried using any tools or apps for that?

[Lina]: Yeah, I use my calendar and a task app, but I often snooze reminders or ignore notifications if I’m not in the right mindset.

[02:30] Riley: That’s common. Let’s consider setting up dedicated external cues—like a visual timer or a sticky note—placed where you work. Also, maybe adjusting the time of your most challenging tasks to when you feel most alert could help.

[Lina]: That makes sense. I tend to be more energized a bit later in the mornings, so shifting some of my deep work to then might be smarter.

[02:35] Riley: Exactly. It’s great you’re noticing your energy patterns. Now, thinking about your overall habits, how are your routines around starting and ending workdays? Do you have a clear “wrap-up” process?

[Lina]: Not really. I often work late into the evening without a formal ending. Sometimes I just close my laptop and think I’ll pick up where I left off tomorrow.

[02:40] Riley: That can lead to inconsistency and burnout. Introducing a brief closing ritual—like reviewing what you accomplished, updating your task list, and setting an intention for tomorrow—can really help you transition out of work mode. Want to try that today?

[Lina]: Yeah, I can do that. It sounds helpful. I think I’ve been avoiding that because I feel guilty about stopping early sometimes.

[02:45] Riley: That’s a common feeling. Remember, boundaries are part of a sustainable routine. Taking a few minutes to close out can actually boost your productivity and energy for the next day. How about I send you a simple template for that wrap-up?

[Lina]: That would be great, thanks.

[02:50] Riley: Perfect. Looking back over the last few months, what’s one thing you feel proud of in how your habits have shifted?

[Lina]: Hmm. I think I’ve become better at recognizing when I’m getting overwhelmed and trying to step back instead of pushing through. Also, I’ve started using my timer more consistently.

[02:55] Riley: Those are huge wins. It shows you’re building awareness and experimenting with strategies—that’s key in this process. As we move forward, I want us to focus on refining your task chunking and establishing that effective wrap-up routine. Does that sound good?

[Lina]: Definitely. I feel like I’m making progress, even if it’s slow sometimes.

[03:00] Riley: That’s the essence of change—steady progress. For next week, I’ll send you a Notion template designed for task chunking and your wrap-up ritual. Plus, let’s plan for you to try a new energy-sensitive time block in the afternoons. Sound good?

[Lina]: Yes, I’m excited to try those out. Thanks, Riley.

[03:05] Riley: You’re welcome! Remember, every small step counts. I’ll check in on your progress next week. Have a productive week ahead, Lina!

[Lina]: Thanks! You too.
