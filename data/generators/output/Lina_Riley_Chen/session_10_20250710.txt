Session 10/24
Date: July 10, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Glad we could connect again today. How have you been since our last session? Any wins or new challenges popping up?

[02:05] Lina: Hey Riley. Yeah, I think I’ve been better. I managed to stick to my morning routine a few days last week, so that was a small victory. But honestly, I still feel pretty stuck when it comes to finishing some bigger projects.

[02:10] Riley: That’s great to hear about the mornings—that’s progress! Sometimes, even small wins can build momentum. Can you tell me more about what’s been making the bigger projects feel overwhelming? Any specific examples?

[02:15] Lina: Sure. Like, I started a new client project last month, and I keep putting off the planning phase. I get distracted, then I feel paralyzed when I think about breaking down all the tasks. It’s like I have this mental block.

[02:20] Riley: That mental block sounds familiar. Sometimes, task paralysis comes from feeling overwhelmed by the scope. Have you tried chunking the project into smaller, more manageable pieces? Maybe even just starting with one tiny task?

[02:25] Lina: I’ve heard of chunking, but I haven’t really applied it systematically. I tend to just think, “There’s so much to do,” and then I freeze.

[02:30] Riley: That’s totally normal. Let’s gamify this a bit. What if we set up a “Task Quest” system? For example, your first quest could be “Define the project scope,” and once you complete it, you earn points. We can track these on your Notion board.

[02:35] Lina: That sounds fun! I like the idea of turning it into a game. It might make it less daunting.

[02:40] Riley: Exactly. Plus, breaking it into tiny steps—like “write a one-sentence project goal” or “list three deliverables”—can make the quest more approachable. How does that feel?

[02:45] Lina: Good. I think I can do that. Also, I’ve been trying to manage my time better with time blocking, but I struggle to stick to it. I keep getting sidetracked.

[02:50] Riley: That’s a common challenge. Do you currently have a schedule or blocks set up for your workday?

[02:55] Lina: I have a rough idea, but I don’t always follow it. Sometimes I leave gaps or switch tasks mid-block.

[03:00] Riley: Let’s try a system called "Focused Time Blocks" with external reminders. For example, set a 25-minute timer for focused work, then a 5-minute break. During that timer, turn off notifications and focus solely on one task. We can set up Notion reminders or alarms. Does that sound doable?

[03:05] Lina: Yeah, I like the idea. I think I need that external cue to stay on track.

[03:10] Riley: Great! And we can track your adherence on your Habit Dashboard, giving you visual feedback on your focus streaks. That can be motivating.

[03:15] Lina: That would be helpful. Sometimes I feel like I’m just spinning my wheels without seeing progress.

[03:20] Riley: Progress tracking is key. Remember how we set up your habit of checking in on your task list every morning? How’s that going?

[03:25] Lina: Honestly, I’ve been inconsistent. Some days I forget, or I get overwhelmed and skip it altogether.

[03:30] Riley: That’s okay. Consistency takes time. Maybe we can add a simple external reminder—say, a daily notification at a set time—that nudges you to review your list. Also, how about using a quick “mini-check-in” at the end of each work session to reflect on what you accomplished?

[03:35] Lina: I like that. It might help me see the small wins better. Speaking of energy, I also struggle with staying energized during the day, especially in the afternoons.

[03:40] Riley: Energy regulation is a big piece. Have you noticed any patterns? When do you feel most sluggish?

[03:45] Lina: Usually after lunch, I get a slump. Sometimes I try a quick walk or a stretch, but it’s inconsistent.

[03:50] Riley: What if we scheduled a “Recharge Break” right after lunch—say, a 10-minute activity that boosts your energy? It could be a walk, some light yoga, or even a fun playlist. We can incorporate that into your calendar as a recurring event.

[03:55] Lina: That sounds doable. I think I need that structured break to reset.

[04:00] Riley: Perfect. And over the past few sessions, we’ve built some good foundational habits. How are you feeling about your overall progress with routines and task management?

[04:05] Lina: Honestly, I feel like I’ve made some headway, but I still get overwhelmed easily. I guess it’s a process.

[04:10] Riley: Absolutely. It’s all about steady, manageable steps. Remember, the goal isn’t perfection but creating systems that support your natural energy and focus rhythms. How do you feel about the idea of weekly check-ins to review your progress and adjust your game plan?

[04:15] Lina: I’d like that. It’ll help me stay accountable and see what’s working or not.

[04:20] Riley: Excellent. So, to summarize today’s action items: First, set up your “Task Quest” system for breaking projects into small steps; second, implement focused time blocks with external reminders; third, schedule a daily energy boost break post-lunch; and finally, set a weekly review to track progress and tweak your routines.

[04:25] Lina: Sounds good. I’ll start with the task chunking and set up those reminders tonight.

[04:30] Riley: Great! And I’ll send you some templates for your Notion setup and a quick guide on your focused time blocks. Next session, we’ll review how these changes are working. Any last questions or thoughts before we wrap up?

[04:35] Lina: No, I think I’m feeling more motivated now. Thanks, Riley. It helps to have a structured plan.

[04:40] Riley: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is about consistency, not perfection. I’ll see you next week—same time?

[04:45] Lina: Yep, same time. Thanks again!

[04:50] Riley: You're welcome! Have a great week, Lina. Talk soon!
