Session 19/24
Date: September 11, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Glad you could make it today. How are you feeling as we kick off session 19?

Lina: Hey Riley! Honestly, a bit tired but excited to get some new strategies going. The last couple of weeks have been a mix—some wins, some setbacks.

[02:05] Riley: That’s totally normal, especially with ongoing changes. Let’s start by revisiting your recent task management—what’s been working well, and where do you feel stuck?

Lina: Well, I’ve been trying to stick to the Notion templates we set up, especially the task chunking system. It’s helped me break down bigger projects, like the client website I’m redesigning. But I still get stuck when I see a huge task and feel paralyzed.

[02:10] Riley: Ah, the classic task paralysis. Remember last time, we talked about external reminders? Have you been using those consistently?

Lina: Yes, I set up alarms and sticky notes on my monitor, but sometimes I ignore them or forget to check them. Especially when I get distracted by emails or quick chats.

[02:15] Riley: That’s common. External cues can be powerful but need to be integrated into a routine. Maybe we can gamify that a bit—like earning points for checking your reminders on time. How does that sound?

Lina (smiling): I like the sound of that. I do love games. It might motivate me to stay more consistent.

[02:20] Riley: Great! Now, about your work schedule—last time, you mentioned struggling with irregular hours. Have you managed to establish a more predictable routine?

Lina: I’ve tried, but it’s still a bit chaotic. Some days I start at 10 am, others at noon, and I often work late into the evening. I think I need a better system for time blocking.

[02:25] Riley: Absolutely. Time blocking is key. Let’s look at your current schedule—do you have any fixed blocks, like client calls or meetings?

Lina: Not really. I mainly work solo, so I tend to work in bursts. Sometimes I get into deep work, but then I get distracted and lose track of time.

[02:30] Riley: So, what if we set specific, gamified time blocks? For example, a 90-minute “Focus Quest” with a reward afterward, like a quick break or a snack. Plus, using your AI Kanban board to visually track these sessions could reinforce the habit.

Lina: That sounds fun! Like a mini game to finish a focus session. I think I could stick to that.

[02:35] Riley: Exactly. And outside of work, how’s your energy regulation? Do you notice times of day when you feel more focused or more sluggish?

Lina: I tend to have energy peaks in the late morning and early evening, but I also hit crashes around 3 pm and after dinner.

[02:40] Riley: Perfect. We can leverage that by scheduling your most demanding tasks during your high-energy windows, and lighter tasks or breaks during the dips. Would you like me to help you set up a personalized daily energy map?

Lina: Yes, that would be helpful. I think knowing when I naturally have energy could really improve my planning.

[02:45] Riley: Great! We’ll incorporate that into your Notion dashboard. Now, let’s talk about progress—over the past six months, what’s shifted for you in terms of completing projects?

Lina: Honestly, I’ve gotten better at breaking tasks down and using external reminders. The gamified approach has made me more aware of my habits. Still, I sometimes struggle with starting tasks, especially when I feel overwhelmed.

[02:50] Riley: That’s normal. Starting is often the hardest part. We can add a “5-minute rule”—commit to just five minutes of work to get the ball rolling. Often, that leads to continuing beyond the initial five.

Lina: I like that. It’s less intimidating. I’ll try that today.

[02:55] Riley: Excellent. To wrap up, let’s set some action items. First, you’ll implement a points system for checking reminders and completing focus sessions. Second, you’ll create a personalized energy map in your Notion. And third, practice the five-minute start rule today.

Lina: Sounds good. I’ll start on these right after this session.

[03:00] Riley: Perfect. Next week, we’ll review how these new strategies are working and tweak them if needed. How does that sound?

Lina: That sounds great. Thanks, Riley. I already feel more motivated just talking about these ideas.

[03:05] Riley: Awesome! Remember, progress is a journey, not a sprint. Looking forward to hearing about your wins next week.

Lina: Me too. Thanks again!

[03:10] Riley: You’re welcome! Have a productive week, Lina. See you next time.
