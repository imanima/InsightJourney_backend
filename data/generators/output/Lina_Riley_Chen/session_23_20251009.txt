[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
(leans forward slightly, warm smile)  

Lina: Hey Riley! I’m doing okay, honestly a bit overwhelmed, but I think that’s pretty normal these days.  

Riley: Totally understandable. It’s good you’re honest about that. I remember last time we talked about feeling a bit stuck with project deadlines and task paralysis. How has your week been with managing those?  

Lina: Um, it’s been… okay. I tried to set some time blocks for coding, but I kept switching tasks or getting distracted by notifications. I think I’m still struggling with sticking to my plans.  

[02:10] Riley: That’s a common hurdle—especially with ADHD. Remember, it’s about building systems that work for your brain, not against it. Did you try that new Notion template we customized last session?  

Lina: Yeah! I actually used it to break down my current project into smaller chunks. It felt good to see everything laid out, but then I’d get to a chunk and not know where to start or I’d get distracted.  

Riley: That’s a good start—breaking it down is key. When you hit that “not knowing where to start,” what’s usually happening? Are you feeling overwhelmed or unsure?  

Lina: Both, I think. Sometimes I just stare at the list and freeze, like my brain goes blank. Or I get distracted by my phone.  

Riley: That’s the task paralysis kicking in. Let’s try a simple trick—what if you pick just the first tiny step for each chunk? Like, open the file, write the first line, then stop. Just a micro-action to start momentum.  

Lina: Hmm, I can try that. It’s like making the first move less intimidating.  

[02:20] Riley: Exactly! And to help with distractions, have you considered setting up external reminders or using app blockers during focused work sessions?  

Lina: I’ve thought about it. I installed a focus app, but I haven’t really used it consistently. I tend to turn it off when I get bored.  

Riley: That’s normal—boredom or discomfort can tempt us to disable those tools. Maybe we can gamify this a bit? Like earning points for keeping the app on for a certain period?  

Lina: That sounds fun! I like the idea of earning points. It makes it feel like a game.  

Riley: Great! Let’s set a goal: for the next week, aim for three focused sessions of at least 20 minutes each, using your app blocker, and track your points. We’ll review your “score dashboard” next session.  

Lina: Okay, I can do that. It feels more motivating when it’s part of a game.  

[02:30] Riley: Awesome. Now, how about your energy levels during the day? Do you notice times when you feel more alert or more sluggish?  

Lina: Yeah, I think I hit a slump around 2 or 3 PM, which is around now. I usually get sleepy or zoned out.  

Riley: Perfect timing to implement some energy regulation strategies. What if you schedule your most demanding tasks during your peak hours and lighter tasks when you’re in the slump?  

Lina: That makes sense. I can move debugging or planning to the morning when I’m sharper. In the afternoon, maybe I can do some light documentation or admin stuff.  

Riley: Exactly. Also, quick physical activity—like a 5-minute stretch or walk—can boost your alertness. Do you want to try adding a mini movement break today?  

Lina: Yeah, I can do that. I think I’ll set a timer every hour to remind myself to stretch or stand up.  

[02:40] Riley: Perfect. That will help regulate your energy and keep you focused longer. Now, reflecting on our progress, last month we worked on establishing a consistent morning routine. How’s that been going?  

Lina: Honestly, it’s improved a bit. I’m waking up a little earlier and trying to do a quick planning session with my coffee. Still some days I skip it, but overall, it’s better.  

Riley: That’s fantastic progress—habit formation takes time. Remember, consistency beats perfection. Let’s keep reinforcing that morning prep as part of your daily routine.  

Lina: Yeah, I’ll keep at it. It’s encouraging to see small wins.  

[02:50] Riley: Absolutely. So, for next week, your action items are:  
- Use the micro-steps for your project chunks, starting small.  
- Implement the gamified focus app with a points goal.  
- Schedule your high-energy tasks during peak hours and light tasks for the slump.  
- Set hourly movement reminders.  

Lina: Got it. I’ll do all that. Thanks, Riley.  

Riley: You’re doing great, Lina. Remember, progress is a journey—every step counts. Can’t wait to hear how the gamification goes next week!  

Lina: Me too. Thanks for the support!  

Riley: Anytime. See you next week!
