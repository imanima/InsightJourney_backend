[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again for our final session—wow, six months already. How are you feeling today?  
(Lina smiles, leaning back slightly)  
Lina: Honestly, I feel a bit mixed. Excited about wrapping this up, but also a little nervous about maintaining what we've built.  

[02:05] Riley: Totally understandable. It’s like finishing a marathon—you’re proud, but also wondering about that post-race stretch. Let’s start by reflecting a little. Last week, you mentioned trying to stick to your new routine of morning planning and chunking tasks into smaller steps. How’s that been going?  
Lina: It’s been okay. Some days I manage, but other days I still get overwhelmed, especially when a big deadline is approaching. I think I still fall into task paralysis sometimes.  

[02:10] Riley: That’s a common challenge, especially with ADHD. Remember, progress isn’t linear. What specific part of the process feels hardest right now?  
Lina: I think it’s the initial starting. Like, I look at my to-do list and just freeze, unsure where to begin. I know I should pick a small task, but I hesitate.  

[02:15] Riley: That hesitation is totally normal. One thing we’ve used before is that external reminder system—like your Notion task prompts—how’s that been?  
Lina: I’ve been trying to set up those reminders, but sometimes I forget to check them or I ignore them when I’m distracted.  

[02:20] Riley: That’s okay. External cues are powerful, but they need to be integrated into your flow. Maybe we can gamify that a bit—like earning points each time you check your reminders and start a task?  
Lina: (laughs) I like that. Turning it into a game sounds more fun than just ticking boxes.  

[02:25] Riley: Exactly! Plus, we can track your progress in a Habit Dashboard. Speaking of which, last session you set a goal to work in focused blocks of 25 minutes with 5-minute breaks—how has that been?  
Lina: I’ve been trying, but sometimes I lose track of time or get distracted after a few cycles. Still a work in progress.  

[02:30] Riley: That’s totally fine. Remember, the purpose of time blocking is to build a sustainable rhythm, not perfection. Have you noticed any patterns about when you feel most focused?  
Lina: I think I’m more focused in the late mornings, before lunch. After that, energy dips and I get restless.  

[02:35] Riley: Great insight. We can tailor your schedule to capitalize on those peak times—like reserving your most demanding tasks for late mornings and lighter work for afternoons. Also, have you tried energy regulation techniques, like quick movement breaks or breathing exercises?  
Lina: I’ve done a few breathing exercises, but I forget to do them regularly. Movement helps sometimes, but I often get caught up in the task.  

[02:40] Riley: That’s where external reminders can come in again—set a timer or an app to prompt movement or breathing breaks. Over time, it becomes a habit. How about your project planning? Last time, we discussed breaking projects into smaller milestones. Are you feeling more confident there?  
Lina: Yes, I think so. I started using my AI Kanban board to visualize stages, which makes the workload feel more manageable. Still working on estimating time for each chunk, though.  

[02:45] Riley: That’s a key skill—estimating time can be tricky for us. Remember the trick we tried: adding a buffer—like 20%—to your time estimates?  
Lina: Yeah, that’s helped. Sometimes I finish early, which boosts my confidence. Other times, I realize I underestimated, but at least I’m getting better at adjusting.  

[02:50] Riley: Awesome progress. It sounds like you’re building a good system. As a final reflection, what’s one thing you want to carry forward from these six months?  
Lina: I think it’s the habit of planning ahead, breaking tasks down, and using external cues. It’s made a big difference, even if I still stumble sometimes.  

[02:55] Riley: That’s fantastic. Remember, maintaining these habits is an ongoing process. As we wrap up, I’ll send you a summary of your personalized system—plus some new gamified challenges for you to try on your own.  
Lina: Thanks, Riley. I appreciate all the tools and support—you’ve really helped me feel more in control.  

[03:00] Riley: You’ve done incredible work, Lina. Keep celebrating your wins, and don’t be too hard on yourself. Our next step is just to keep practicing what works and adjusting as needed.  
Lina: Sounds good. I’ll keep at it. Thanks again!  

[03:05] Riley: My pleasure. Have a great rest of your day, and I look forward to hearing about your continued progress!  
(Lina smiles warmly, nodding)  
Lina: Will do. Bye!
