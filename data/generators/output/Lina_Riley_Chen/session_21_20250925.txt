Session 21/24
Date: September 25, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How have things been since our last session? Any wins or surprises?

[02:05] Lina: Hey Riley. Thanks! Honestly, I’ve been trying to stick to the new routine we set up—chunking tasks and using those timers. It’s been a bit better, but I still find myself procrastinating on the bigger projects.

[02:10] Riley: That’s totally normal—progress with these things is rarely linear. I’m glad to hear you’re experimenting with the routines. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s been working well and where you’re hitting snags?

[02:15] Lina: Well, I’ve been using the Notion templates more consistently to break down tasks. For example, I finally finished that client website project. But I still struggle with starting the tasks — I get stuck in that paralysis, especially when I see a long to-do list.

[02:20] Riley: Ah, task paralysis—that’s a common challenge. So, even with the system in place, getting over that initial hurdle is tough. Did you try the “just 5 minutes” rule we discussed last time? Like committing to work on a task for just five minutes?

[02:25] Lina: Yeah, I did! And surprisingly, once I started, I could keep going for a bit longer. It’s like the first step is the hardest.

[02:30] Riley: Exactly! That’s a great insight. It’s often about lowering the activation energy. Have you thought about using external reminders, like alarms or sticky notes, to prompt you to start? Or maybe a progress cue—like checking off small chunks as you finish them?

[02:35] Lina: I like the sticky notes idea. I could put one on my monitor with “Just 5 minutes” or “Start now.” That might help trigger that initial action.

[02:40] Riley: Perfect! And speaking of chunks, how are your task breakdowns going? Are the smaller steps clear enough, or do some still feel overwhelming?

[02:45] Lina: I think I need to get better at that. Sometimes I write down a big task like “Finish client app,” but I don’t break it into smaller steps. So I end up procrastinating because it feels huge.

[02:50] Riley: That’s a common trap. Remember, the key is to make each step as bite-sized as possible. For example, instead of “Finish client app,” you might have “Write login module” or “Review API documentation.” Have you tried using the habit tracker dashboard to monitor these smaller steps?

[02:55] Lina: Not yet, but I think I should. It might motivate me to see progress on the smaller parts.

[03:00] Riley: Absolutely. Visual progress can be very motivating, especially for ADHD brains. Now, how’s your energy regulation been? Are you noticing times of day when you feel more focused or more sluggish?

[03:05] Lina: Yeah, I’ve noticed I’m sharper in the mornings, but around 3 or 4 pm, I get hit with a slump. I’ve been trying to do lighter tasks then, but I still feel a bit foggy.

[03:10] Riley: That’s a good observation. Have you tried scheduling your most complex or demanding tasks during your peak energy periods? And maybe lighter, more routine tasks during the slump?

[03:15] Lina: I could do that. I usually just try to push through, but maybe I need to be more strategic about it.

[03:20] Riley: Definitely. Also, incorporating quick energy boosts—like short walks or stretching—can help reset your focus. Do you have any quick routines for that?

[03:25] Lina: Not yet, but that’s a good idea. I’ll try setting a timer for a 5-minute stretch break when I notice my energy dipping.

[03:30] Riley: Great! That can create external cues to help you reset. Now, looking ahead, what’s one area you want to focus on improving before our next session?

[03:35] Lina: I think I want to work on starting tasks more easily, especially the bigger ones. Maybe refining my chunking process and using more external reminders.

[03:40] Riley: That sounds like a solid plan. For next week, I suggest you pick one big task and break it down into small, actionable steps. Use your sticky note reminders and track your progress on your habit dashboard. And try the 5-minute start rule whenever you feel stuck.

[03:45] Lina: Will do. And I’ll also experiment with energy management during my slump times.

[03:50] Riley: Perfect! Remember, small consistent steps add up. And I’ll be here to support you along the way. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions or anything else you want to share?

[03:55] Lina: Not right now. I feel more confident about tackling those big tasks now. Thanks, Riley.

[03:58] Riley: You’re very welcome! Excited to hear how it goes. Let’s check in on your progress next week. Have a great week, Lina!

[04:00] Lina: Thanks, you too! Bye!
