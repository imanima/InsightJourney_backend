[02:00] Riley: Hey Lina! Glad you could make it today. How’s everything been since our last session? Any wins or challenges you want to start with?

[02:03] Lina: Hi Riley! Thanks. Well, I think I’ve been better at sticking to my schedule, but I still get stuck on tasks a lot. Like yesterday, I had a clear plan, but then I just froze on a big project and wasted hours trying to figure out where to start.

[02:07] Riley: That’s a common place to hit a wall, especially with big projects. So, you mentioned having a plan—what did that look like? Did you break the project into parts?

[02:10] Lina: Yeah, I had a To-Do list with all the main steps, but I guess I didn’t break it down enough. It still felt overwhelming, so I kept procrastinating.

[02:13] Riley: That’s a good insight. Sometimes, breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks can really help. Let’s try a quick exercise—pick a part of your project and tell me how you could chunk it even further.

[02:16] Lina: Hmm, okay. Let’s see. One part is designing the user interface. I could break that down into sketching wireframes, choosing colors, and then creating mockups. I guess I could even break it down more: for wireframes, I could set a timer for 20 minutes and just sketch ideas without judgment.

[02:20] Riley: Exactly! The idea is to create micro-tasks that feel doable. It’s like turning a big boss battle into several tiny side quests. How does that sound?

[02:22] Lina: Actually, that sounds helpful. I tend to see the big project as a single monster, which makes me want to avoid it altogether.

[02:25] Riley: That’s a great visual. Now, thinking about your schedule, how have your time blocks been working? Are you sticking to dedicated work periods?

[02:28] Lina: Sort of. I’ve been trying to set blocks in my calendar, but I still get distracted or interrupted. Sometimes I forget to turn on focus mode, or I get pulled into emails.

[02:31] Riley: External reminders can really help with that. Do you have an alert system or a specific cue to start your focus blocks?

[02:34] Lina: I use notifications from my task app, but I admit I sometimes ignore them or snooze them.

[02:36] Riley: Maybe we can gamify that a bit—like earning points for starting your focus sessions promptly. Also, do you have a visual cue, like a specific workspace or a signal when you’re in focus mode?

[02:39] Lina: I could set a special playlist or put a "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door. I like the idea of a visual cue.

[02:42] Riley: Perfect! Rituals like that can act as external triggers to help you shift into focus. Now, how’s your energy level during the day? Are you noticing times when you’re more or less focused?

[02:45] Lina: Yeah, I tend to have a lot of energy in the mornings but then crash mid-afternoon. That’s when I struggle most with getting anything done.

[02:48] Riley: That’s important to note. Have you tried adjusting your schedule to align challenging tasks with your high-energy periods?

[02:51] Lina: Not systematically, no. I usually just work whenever I can, which isn’t always when I feel most alert.

[02:54] Riley: Let’s set up a simple energy tracker—maybe a quick daily log or a mood chart—to identify patterns. Then we can plan your most demanding tasks for your peak times. How does that sound?

[02:58] Lina: That makes sense. I think I can do that. It might help me see the patterns clearly.

[03:00] Riley: Great. And as a quick recap, today we’re focusing on breaking down tasks further, enhancing your external cues for focus, and tracking your energy. Sound good?

[03:03] Lina: Yes, definitely. I already feel a bit more motivated just talking about these ideas.

[03:05] Riley: Awesome! Now, for next week, I’d like you to pick one big project and break it into micro-tasks, set up a focus cue, and start tracking your energy levels. We’ll review how it went in our next session.

[03:08] Lina: Will do. Thanks, Riley. I appreciate your help in making this feel more manageable.

[03:10] Riley: My pleasure! Remember, progress is about small wins. And I’m excited to see your next steps. See you next week, Lina!

[03:12] Lina: Thanks! Bye!
