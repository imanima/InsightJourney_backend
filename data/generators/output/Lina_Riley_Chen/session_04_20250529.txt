Session 4/24
Date: May 29, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hey Lina! Glad we could connect today. How have you been since our last session? Any wins or surprises you'd like to share?

[Lina]: Hey Riley! Yeah, I think I’ve been better. I managed to stick to my morning routine most days, so that’s a small win. But I still struggle a lot with starting tasks, especially bigger projects. Sometimes I just freeze up.

[02:10] Riley: That’s totally normal—especially with ADHD. The fact that you’re sticking to your morning routine is a solid step. Can you tell me more about what happens when you face that task paralysis? Are there specific kinds of projects or tasks that feel more overwhelming?

[Lina]: Yeah, it’s mainly when I get new client projects that require a lot of planning and figuring out where to start. I look at the whole thing and just... shut down. I end up procrastinating or wasting time on small stuff that’s not urgent.

[02:15] Riley: That makes sense. That feeling of being overwhelmed by the big picture can be tough. Let’s try a technique I call “chunking”—breaking projects into tiny, manageable pieces. For example, instead of “start new client project,” what’s the very first small step you could take?

[Lina]: Maybe... just opening the project file, or sketching a rough outline?

[02:20] Riley: Exactly! Starting with just opening the file or jotting down a quick outline. It lowers the barrier to get going. Have you tried that before?

[Lina]: I’ve heard of it, but I haven’t really committed to it. I usually think I need to do everything at once to make progress.

[02:25] Riley: That’s a common misconception. Think of it like a game—each small step is a level-up. Speaking of which, how’s your habit dashboard looking? Are you tracking these tiny steps?

[Lina]: I’ve been using Notion, but honestly I forget to update it sometimes. I think I need a better reminder system.

[02:30] Riley: Perfect segue! External reminders can be game-changers. Do you want to set up a simple system today? Maybe scheduled notifications or a recurring prompt?

[Lina]: Yeah, that’d help. Maybe I can set a daily reminder to review my project chunks and update my progress.

[02:35] Riley: Great idea. Let’s do that now. I’ll help you set a recurring reminder in your phone for 10 minutes before your usual work start time. Also, how are your energy levels throughout the day? Do you notice times when you’re more focused?

[Lina]: Hmm, I tend to be most alert mid-morning, but sometimes I crash in the late afternoon.

[02:40] Riley: That’s common. To optimize your work, you might try scheduling your most demanding tasks during your high-energy windows. For the lower-energy times, maybe lighter tasks or breaks. Have you experimented with energy regulation techniques, like short movement breaks or quick mindfulness exercises?

[Lina]: Not enough, honestly. I get so caught up, I forget to pause.

[02:45] Riley: Let’s add a “Pomodoro” style timer—25 minutes work, 5-minute break—into your routine. During breaks, do some quick stretches or deep breathing. We can even gamify it: track your streaks of focused sessions in your Habit Dashboard. How does that sound?

[Lina]: I like that! It makes it feel more like a challenge, which motivates me.

[02:50] Riley: Perfect. So, to summarize today: we’re breaking projects into tiny steps, setting external reminders, scheduling your high-energy work blocks, and implementing timed focus sessions. How does that feel as a plan?

[Lina]: Honestly, it feels doable. Less overwhelming than trying to do everything at once.

[02:55] Riley: That’s the goal—small, manageable wins leading to bigger progress. For next time, I’d like you to try chunking one of your current projects, set up your reminder system, and track your focused sessions. We’ll review how it went and troubleshoot any hurdles.

[Lina]: Sounds good. Thanks, Riley. I already feel a bit more hopeful about tackling my projects.

[03:00] Riley: Awesome, Lina. You’re making great strides. Remember, progress isn’t linear—celebrate each tiny win. See you next week, and I’ll be excited to hear how the new system works for you.

[Lina]: Thanks! Talk soon! (smiles)
