Client: Lina (Freelance Developer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Lina! Great to see you again. How has your week been? Any wins or challenges since our last session?

[02:03] Lina: Hey Riley! Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I managed to finish a couple of smaller projects on time, which felt good, but I also got stuck again on that big client proposal. I keep procrastinating on breaking it down properly.

[02:07] Riley: That’s a familiar pattern—big projects can feel overwhelming, right? But hey, you’re making progress with the smaller stuff, so that’s a positive sign. Want to start by revisiting how your task organization has been lately? Any new strategies you've tried?

[02:10] Lina: Well, I did try to use the Notion template we set up last time. I liked the idea of visualizing my tasks, but honestly, I get distracted before I even start. I see all these tabs and options and just freeze.

[02:14] Riley: Ah, the classic "paralysis by analysis" moment. That’s super common. Maybe the visual complexity is a bit intimidating. How about we simplify your setup? Maybe focusing on just one or two priority areas for now?

[02:17] Lina: Yeah, I think that would help. I was thinking about just doing a daily top three tasks and using a simple Kanban board for those. Less clutter, less overwhelm.

[02:20] Riley: Perfect! That aligns well with our gamified approach—think of it as your daily "mission list." How does that sound?

[02:23] Lina: I like that. It feels less daunting, and I can check things off easily. Plus, I like the idea of earning points for completing those top three.

[02:26] Riley: Exactly! Rewards boost motivation. Speaking of which, how have your focus sessions been? Are you experimenting with time blocking or any focus techniques?

[02:29] Lina: I’ve tried a bit of time blocking, but I keep slipping into my old habits—getting distracted or switching tasks too often. I think I need external reminders or alarms.

[02:33] Riley: That makes sense. External cues can really anchor your focus. Have you considered setting up timers or app notifications that prompt you to switch tasks or take breaks?

[02:36] Lina: Yes, I set a few alarms on my phone, but sometimes I ignore them when I get into flow, which probably defeats the purpose.

[02:39] Riley: That’s a common challenge—finding that balance between flow and structure. Maybe we can try a system where the alarms serve as gentle nudges, not just alarms to stop, but to check in on your progress. Like a "focus checkpoint."

[02:43] Lina: I like that. It feels less punitive and more like a friendly reminder. Also, I’ve noticed that I get energy dips in the afternoons, which make it hard to stay focused.

[02:46] Riley: Energy regulation is key. Have you tried energy management techniques, like quick movement breaks or mini energizing routines during low-energy times?

[02:50] Lina: Not really. I usually just push through, but I think I need to listen to my body more. Maybe short stretching or a quick walk could help.

[02:53] Riley: Absolutely. Even 5-minute movement breaks can reset your focus. Think of it as recharging your internal "battery." Do you want to set a goal for incorporating these breaks into your daily routine?

[02:57] Lina: Yes, I think I can aim for two movement breaks in the afternoon, say around 2:30 and 4:00. I’ll set those alarms.

[03:00] Riley: Great plan! Now, reflecting on your big project—the proposal—what’s the next small step that feels manageable?

[03:05] Lina: I guess I could start by outlining the main sections—introduction, scope, timeline. Just that for now, no deep writing.

[03:08] Riley: Perfect. Chunking that large task into its parts makes it less intimidating. And maybe for accountability, you can allocate 20-minute focused sessions for this outline, with your timers.

[03:12] Lina: That sounds doable. I’ll give it a try today. Also, I’ve been thinking about my overall schedule—sometimes I work late into the night, which messes with my energy the next day.

[03:15] Riley: Night owl tendencies can definitely impact your focus and mood. Would you be open to experimenting with a more consistent bedtime or a wind-down routine?

[03:19] Lina: Yeah, I think that would help. Maybe I could set a reminder to start winding down at 10 pm and avoid screens an hour before bed.

[03:22] Riley: Excellent. Small shifts like that can have a big impact on energy levels. So, to summarize today: you’ll simplify your task management with a daily top three, set timers for focus and breaks, start outlining your proposal in chunks, and establish a consistent bedtime routine.

[03:27] Lina: Yes, that covers it. Thanks, Riley. I already feel a bit more motivated just talking through these steps.

[03:30] Riley: That’s the power of breaking things down and externalizing your plan. Remember, progress is about small wins—celebrate each one. Next week, we can review how these new habits are working and tweak if needed.

[03:34] Lina: Sounds good. I’ll keep track and come prepared with my progress. Thanks again!

[03:36] Riley: You’re welcome, Lina. Keep up the great work, and I’ll see you next week! Have a productive day.
