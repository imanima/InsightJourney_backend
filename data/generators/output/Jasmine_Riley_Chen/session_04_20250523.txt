[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! It’s great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
(Jasmine gives a small smile, slightly tired but engaged)  
Jasmine: Hi Riley. Honestly, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything going on at work and trying to juggle home life too. It’s a lot.  

[02:05] Riley: That’s understandable, especially with everything shifting so quickly. Last time, we touched on setting some clearer boundaries around your work hours. How has that been going?  
Jasmine: I’ve tried to stick to my planned work blocks, but I find myself checking emails after hours or getting pulled into urgent things. It’s hard to fully disconnect.  

[02:10] Riley: That’s a common challenge. Let’s explore what’s making it hard to disconnect. Are there specific triggers or situations that pull you back into work?  
Jasmine: Mostly, it’s the feeling that I might miss something important, especially since I manage a team, and I want to be available for them. Also, sometimes I get into a flow and don’t want to break it.  

[02:15] Riley: That’s a good insight. It sounds like your desire to be responsive is strong. How about we implement a structured “end of work” ritual that signals to your brain that the workday is over? Maybe a specific activity or a visual cue?  
Jasmine: That could help. Maybe I could turn off email notifications and do a quick walk or some stretching.  

[02:20] Riley: Perfect. The visual cue could be turning off notifications and closing your work apps. The walk or stretch becomes a clear boundary marker. How does that sound?  
Jasmine: I like it. I think it’ll help me transition better. I also want to talk about energy management. Some days I feel drained by midday, and I struggle to focus later.  

[02:25] Riley: That’s very common, especially with new motherhood. Let’s map out your energy patterns. When do you notice your energy peaks and dips?  
Jasmine: I usually feel most energized in the morning after breakfast, but by early afternoon, I get tired, especially if I’ve been on screens a lot.  

[02:30] Riley: Great. So, we can leverage your morning energy by scheduling your most demanding tasks then. For the afternoon, maybe lighter tasks or breaks. Have you tried any specific energy-boosting strategies?  
Jasmine: I’ve tried quick movement or coffee, but I want something more sustainable, especially with a baby around.  

[02:35] Riley: How about incorporating brief energy resets—like a few minutes of breathing exercises or gentle stretching—during your workday? And maybe adjusting your work schedule slightly if possible?  
Jasmine: I could try that. I like the breathing exercises—they’re quick and calming.  

[02:40] Riley: Excellent. Now, regarding your work-life boundaries at home, how do you feel about your current setup with the baby?  
Jasmine: It’s still a work in progress. I try to be present with her, but I often find myself sneaking in tasks or feeling guilty about not working.  

[02:45] Riley: That’s a common feeling. Let’s talk about intentionality. Have you considered designating specific “family focus” blocks, where you fully disconnect from work? Maybe even communicating these to your team?  
Jasmine: I haven’t explicitly communicated that. I worry about missing urgent stuff.  

[02:50] Riley: It’s understandable. But clear, communicated boundaries can actually reduce that feeling of missing out, because your team knows when you’re unavailable. Perhaps a simple message or status update could help set expectations.  
Jasmine: That makes sense. I can try setting a status on Slack or sending a quick message at the start of my family time.  

[02:55] Riley: Great idea. Also, how are you feeling about your progress over the past month? Any wins or areas you want to celebrate?  
Jasmine: I think I’ve gotten better at turning off after hours, and I’ve started using the habit tracker to remind me. It’s still a work in progress, but I feel more aware.  

[03:00] Riley: That’s wonderful progress, Jasmine. Awareness is the first step. It’s normal for habits to take time to solidify. Let’s set some specific goals for the next week:  
- Implement the end-of-work ritual with notifications and a walk or stretch  
- Communicate your family boundaries clearly to your team  
- Practice a 2-minute breathing reset mid-afternoon  

[03:05] Jasmine: Sounds good. I’ll give those a try.  
Riley: Perfect. Before we wrap up, do you want to share anything else that’s on your mind or any support you need from me?  
Jasmine: Just knowing I have these tools and someone to check in with helps a lot. Sometimes I still feel guilty about juggling everything, but I’m learning to be kinder to myself.  

[03:10] Riley: That’s a powerful realization. Remember, progress is a journey, not a sprint. Keep celebrating your wins, big or small. Our next session, we can review how the new boundaries and routines are working.  
Jasmine: Thank you, Riley. I appreciate the support.  

[03:15] Riley: You’re very welcome. Have a great week, Jasmine, and I look forward to hearing about your successes next time.  
Jasmine: Thanks! See you next week.  

[03:20] Riley: Bye!
