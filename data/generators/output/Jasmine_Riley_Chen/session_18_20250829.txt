[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How’s your week been? Any wins or challenges you'd like to share today?

[02:02] Jasmine: Hey Riley! Thanks. It’s been a bit hectic, honestly. I managed to stick to my new time-blocking system most days, but I still feel like I’m constantly battling to keep my boundaries at work. Especially with the baby—sometimes I find myself checking emails after hours.

[02:04] Riley: That’s a common challenge, especially when juggling work and family. It’s great you’re using time blocking—that’s a solid foundation. How has that been working for you? Any particular blocks that feel tricky to enforce?

[02:07] Jasmine: Yeah, the blocks during my work hours are pretty good, but once I hit the evening, I tend to drift back into work mode. I think I’m worried about missing deadlines or just feeling behind.

[02:09] Riley: That’s understandable. It sounds like your brain is conditioned to stay in work mode even when you’re off the clock. Have you tried any specific strategies to reinforce your boundaries, like a ritual to switch off or a dedicated family time signal?

[02:11] Jasmine: Not really a ritual, no. I usually just tell myself I should stop working, but then I get distracted or I feel guilty if I don’t finish everything.

[02:13] Riley: Guilt can be a tough emotion to manage, especially when you care so much about your work and your family. How about we try creating a simple end-of-work ritual? Something that signals the transition—like a walk, a playlist, or even a quick journaling session about your accomplishments that day.

[02:15] Jasmine: I like that idea. Maybe I can go for a short walk or do some deep breathing. It might help me disconnect mentally.

[02:17] Riley: Perfect. And let’s also set an explicit “shutdown” time. For example, after 6:30 PM, no work-related email or tasks. Do you think that’s doable?

[02:19] Jasmine: Yes, I think I can commit to that. It might be challenging at first, but I see how it could help.

[02:21] Riley: Absolutely. It’s about building that boundary muscle, just like a workout. Now, shifting gears a bit—how are you feeling energy-wise during the day? Any patterns or dips you’ve noticed?

[02:23] Jasmine: Well, mornings are good—I feel alert and focused. But after lunch, I often hit a slump, especially when I try to do deep coding work. I end up procrastinating or switching to easier tasks just to get through.

[02:25] Riley: That’s a classic post-lunch dip. Have you experimented with energy management techniques, like short movement breaks or mini mindfulness sessions during that slump?

[02:27] Jasmine: Not yet, but I’ve heard about those. I usually just power through, but I know that’s not ideal.

[02:29] Riley: Let’s try embedding a 5-minute movement break or a quick breathing exercise after lunch. Even standing up and stretching can boost your alertness. Would you be willing to experiment with that this week?

[02:31] Jasmine: Definitely. I think I’d benefit from that. Maybe I can set a timer or an alarm as a reminder.

[02:33] Riley: Great idea. Setting reminders helps make it habitual. Now, I also wanted to revisit your goal of work-life balance, especially with your new motherhood role. How are you feeling about your progress there?

[02:35] Jasmine: Honestly, it’s a constant juggling act. Some days I feel good about carving out family time, but other days I get caught up in work emergencies. I want to be more consistent with quality family moments without feeling guilty.

[02:37] Riley: That’s a common feeling. How about scheduling specific “family blocks” in your calendar—like dedicated play or meal times—and treating them as non-negotiables?

[02:39] Jasmine: I like that. I think putting it into my calendar would make it more concrete. Maybe even blocking out “no work” during those times.

[02:41] Riley: Exactly. And during those blocks, practice fully being present—no checking your phone or email. It’s a way to reinforce your boundaries and enjoy quality family time.

[02:43] Jasmine: That makes sense. I’ll try that starting this week.

[02:45] Riley: Excellent. As we wrap up, I want to acknowledge how much progress you’ve made over these 18 sessions—building routines, setting boundaries, managing energy. It’s impressive!

[02:47] Jasmine: Thanks, Riley. I do feel like I’m getting better at managing things, even if it’s still a work in progress.

[02:49] Riley: That’s the key—progress over perfection. For next steps, let’s create your personalized boundary ritual plan and energy management toolkit. I’ll send you some templates and reminders to support these habits.

[02:51] Jasmine: Sounds good. I’m looking forward to trying these new strategies.

[02:53] Riley: Great. And next week, we can check in on how your boundary practices and energy techniques are going, and adjust as needed. Any questions before we finish?

[02:55] Jasmine: Not right now. Thanks for the support, Riley. I feel more confident about tackling these areas.

[02:57] Riley: You’re welcome! Keep celebrating your wins, and remember, each small step counts. Talk soon!

[02:59] Jasmine: Talk soon! Bye!

[03:00] Riley: Bye!
