[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How has your week been? Any wins or challenges you'd like to share today?

[02:03] Jasmine: Hi Riley! Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit hectic. I did manage to set some boundaries around my work hours, which felt good, but I still struggle with feeling guilty about stepping away when the baby needs me.

[02:05] Riley: That’s a huge step—kudos for establishing those boundaries! Guilt can be tricky, especially when juggling work and family. Let’s explore that a bit. When you think about stepping away, what thoughts come up?

[02:08] Jasmine: I guess I worry that I’m falling behind at work or that I’m not giving enough attention to my team. Like I should be constantly available, even if I’m technically off the clock.

[02:10] Riley: That’s a common feeling, especially in our digital age. Remember from last time we discussed your Notion workspace and how you’ve been using time blocks? How’s that been working for you this week?

[02:12] Jasmine: It’s been helpful. I’ve been blocking mornings for deep work—like coding or design reviews—and afternoons for meetings or admin. But I sometimes find myself checking email or Slack outside those blocks, feeling guilty if I don’t respond immediately.

[02:15] Riley: That’s understandable. Have you considered setting specific 'email-free' periods or turning notifications off during your deep work blocks? Sometimes, controlling our environment helps reduce that guilt and distraction.

[02:17] Jasmine: I like that idea. I did try muting notifications yesterday, and I felt more focused. I think I need a more structured plan for when to check messages.

[02:20] Riley: Absolutely. How about we create a 'priority map' for your communication? For example, urgent messages only during certain times, with a clear window for checking non-urgent stuff. Would that help?

[02:22] Jasmine: Yes, I think that would give me more control. Plus, I can reassure my team that I’ll respond at specific times, which might ease my guilt.

[02:25] Riley: Perfect. That ties into assertive communication—setting clear expectations. Have you practiced any scripts to communicate these boundaries?

[02:27] Jasmine: Not yet, but I was thinking of saying something like, "I’ll be focusing on deep work until 2 PM. If it’s urgent, please mark it as high priority."

[02:30] Riley: That’s clear and respectful. Practice delivering that, perhaps in front of a mirror or in a quick email draft. It can help make it feel more natural when you do it live.

[02:32] Jasmine: Good idea. I’ll try that today. Also, I wanted to ask about energy management. Some days I feel drained, especially after nighttime feedings. Any tips?

[02:35] Riley: Managing energy with a newborn is tough—so kudos for recognizing your limits. One technique we can revisit is the 'energy audit.' How do you usually feel during different parts of the day?

[02:37] Jasmine: Mornings are usually decent—I have a good chunk of energy after I wake up—but by late afternoon, I’m exhausted. I’ve been trying to nap when the baby naps, but it’s inconsistent.

[02:40] Riley: That’s normal. To optimize what you do have, consider scheduling your most demanding tasks during your peak energy times. Also, short power naps of 15-20 minutes can be restorative. Have you tried that?

[02:42] Jasmine: I haven’t been consistent with naps, but I think I could carve out time for a quick rest. It’s just hard to break the cycle sometimes.

[02:45] Riley: It’s all about small wins. Maybe set a reminder or an alarm to take that 20-minute nap. Also, incorporating brief stretching or breathing exercises can boost your energy.

[02:47] Jasmine: That makes sense. I’ll give it a shot. On a related note, I want to better balance my work growth and family time—feels like I’m constantly trying to catch up.

[02:50] Riley: Balancing growth and family is a dynamic challenge. Let’s revisit your long-term goals for your career. What’s your vision for the next 6 months?

[02:52] Jasmine: I want to lead a project at work, maybe mentor some juniors, but I also want to be present with my baby and feel less overwhelmed.

[02:55] Riley: Great. Let’s break that down into actionable steps. For example, scheduling time for mentorship prep, discussing flexible leadership roles with your manager, and carving out dedicated family time.

[02:58] Jasmine: That sounds manageable. I think if I have a clear plan, I won’t feel so scattered.

[03:00] Riley: Exactly. Having a structured plan with clear boundaries and priorities can reduce that overwhelm. Before we wrap up, do you want to review your action items?

[03:03] Jasmine: Yes. I’ll set specific times for checking emails, mute notifications outside those times, practice a boundary script, and try a short energy-boosting nap today.

[03:05] Riley: Perfect. For next time, we’ll check how those strategies are working and refine your energy management and boundary-setting techniques. How does that sound?

[03:07] Jasmine: Sounds good. Thanks, Riley. I feel more in control already.

[03:09] Riley: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, small consistent steps create big change. See you next week!

[03:10] Jasmine: Thanks! Have a good week.
