Session 22/24
Date: September 26, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Jasmine (Front-end Engineer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
(Jasmine smiles, settling into her chair)  
Jasmine: Hi Riley! Honestly, a bit tired but good. It’s been a busy week balancing work and the baby. But I’m glad we’re here.  

[02:05] Riley: That’s understandable—being a new mom and a senior engineer is no small feat! Last time, we talked about setting clearer boundaries between work and family. How has that been going?  
Jasmine: I’ve tried to stick to specific work hours, like 9 to 4, but sometimes deadlines slip, and I stay on later. I also find it hard to disconnect completely once I’m done.  

[02:10] Riley: That’s a common challenge. Were you able to implement any of the time blocking strategies we discussed?  
Jasmine: Yes, I started blocking my calendar for focused work, especially mornings. But I notice I sometimes get caught up in small tasks or notifications, which eats into that time.  

[02:15] Riley: Perfect. Recognizing those interruptions is a good step. Maybe we can add a quick "notification check" slot—say, every hour—so it doesn’t derail your focus. How does that sound?  
Jasmine: That sounds helpful. I think I’m also struggling with energy dips in the afternoon, which makes it hard to stick to the schedule.  

[02:20] Riley: Energy management is key, especially with a little one at home. Have you noticed specific times when your energy drops, or activities that seem to drain you more?  
Jasmine: Definitely. Around 2 or 3 pm, I feel sluggish, especially after lunch. If I push through, I get less productive. Also, caring for my baby during the day sometimes tires me out more than I expect.  

[02:25] Riley: That’s very insightful. Let’s consider incorporating short energy boosts—like quick stretches, a glass of water, or a quick walk outside—at those low points. Have you tried anything similar?  
Jasmine: Not consistently, but I like the idea. Sometimes I just power through because I think I should.  

[02:30] Riley: That’s a common mindset, but self-care is part of productivity. We can gamify this—perhaps earning points or badges for taking energy-restoring breaks? Would that motivate you?  
Jasmine: I love that! Making it a game sounds fun. I think it’d help me remember to pause instead of pushing through.  

[02:35] Riley: Excellent! Now, about your boundary setting—how confident do you feel about asserting your limits with your team when deadlines threaten your schedule?  
Jasmine: I’ve been nervous about saying no or pushing back, especially with tight deadlines. I worry about seeming uncooperative.  

[02:40] Riley: That’s a common concern. Remember, clear communication is your ally. We can craft a script or key phrases to assert your boundaries politely but firmly. Would you like to role-play an example?  
Jasmine: Yes, please. That would help.  

[02:45] Riley: Great. Imagine a situation where someone asks for an urgent fix right before your designated family time. You might say, “I understand this is important, but I have commitments right now. Can we prioritize this first thing tomorrow?” How does that feel?  
Jasmine: It feels doable. I like the polite but firm tone. I just need to practice it to feel more natural.  

[02:50] Riley: Absolutely. Practice makes perfect. We’ll add that to your boundary toolkit. Now, reflecting on your overall energy and time management, what do you think is your biggest win since our last session?  
Jasmine: I think I’ve been more consistent with my calendar blocking. Even if I don’t stick perfectly, I notice I start my workday more intentionally.  

[02:55] Riley: That’s fantastic progress. Small shifts like that build momentum. Moving forward, let’s set a concrete goal: this week, try implementing your energy boosts at 2 pm and practice a boundary script in one or two situations. How does that sound?  
Jasmine: It sounds good. I’ll give it a try.  

[03:00] Riley: Awesome. And let’s check in on your habit tracker next time to see how those changes are sticking. Any questions or anything else you want to focus on today?  
Jasmine: I think that covers it. I feel more confident about managing my schedule and setting boundaries. Thanks, Riley.  

[03:05] Riley: You’re doing great, Jasmine. Remember, progress is a process. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll review how these new strategies are working. Have a wonderful, energy-filled week with your family!  
Jasmine: Thanks so much, Riley. See you next week!
