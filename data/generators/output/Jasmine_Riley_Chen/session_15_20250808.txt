Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Glad we could connect today. How are you feeling about our session?  
(Jasmine smiles softly)  
Jasmine: Hi Riley. Honestly, a bit overwhelmed but also motivated. I’ve been trying to implement some of the time blocking techniques we discussed last week, but I’m still adjusting.  

[02:05] Riley: That’s totally normal—adjusting to new routines takes time, especially with everything going on at home. Let’s start by revisiting what you’ve tried so far. Can you tell me about your current approach to managing work and family time?  
(Jasmine nods, thinking)  
Jasmine: Well, I’ve been blocking mornings for deep work—like from 9 to 11—then some meetings afterwards. But I often find myself drifting into baby care or household tasks during those blocks.  

[02:10] Riley: Ah, yes. That’s a common challenge. It’s great you’re setting those blocks—what do you notice about what pulls you away?  
(Jasmine fidgets slightly)  
Jasmine: Honestly, sometimes I feel guilty leaving my baby to focus, so I check on her or respond quickly to her needs. Plus, I think I underestimate how long certain tasks take, so I get distracted.  

[02:15] Riley: That’s a very human experience—guilt and underestimating task duration. Have you tried any specific strategies to help reinforce your boundaries, like visual cues or alarms?  
Jasmine: I’ve used alarms, but I tend to ignore them sometimes. I think I need something more visual, like a timer that I can see from my workspace.  

[02:20] Riley: That’s a great idea. Visual timers can be powerful. Let’s think about integrating a prominent timer or visual cue that signals “work time” clearly. Also, how do you feel about redefining your “deep work” blocks to include a brief buffer for transitions? Sometimes, a five-minute reset helps shift focus.  
(Jasmine nods)  
Jasmine: That might help. I often jump straight into work after attending to my baby, and then I get distracted trying to switch gears.  

[02:25] Riley: Exactly. Transition buffers are a game-changer—think of them as your mental reset buttons. Now, considering energy levels: How do you feel your energy fluctuates during the day, especially between baby care and work?  
Jasmine: Mornings are pretty good, but by mid-afternoon, I feel drained. I think I need to find ways to boost my energy or reset myself.  

[02:30] Riley: That’s common, especially with new motherhood. Have you experimented with short movement breaks, hydration, or quick mindfulness practices during the day?  
Jasmine: I’ve tried a few stretches here and there, but I haven’t been consistent. I also realized I forget to hydrate enough.  

[02:35] Riley: Hydration and movement are simple yet effective. Let’s build into your schedule a 5-minute movement or hydration check-in—maybe right after your deep work block. Also, what about a quick mindfulness moment—like a breathing exercise—before switching tasks?  
Jasmine: I like that idea. It could help me feel more centered and less frazzled.  

[02:40] Riley: Perfect. Now, reflecting on your work-life boundaries—how comfortable do you feel asserting your needs with your team or family?  
(Jasmine hesitates)  
Jasmine: Honestly, I struggle a bit. I don’t want to seem uncooperative, but I also need to protect my time. I’ve been hesitant to say no sometimes.  

[02:45] Riley: That’s very common. Let’s practice some assertive communication techniques. For example, framing requests clearly: “I’m focusing on a deadline during this time, can we connect afterward?” How does that feel?  
Jasmine: That sounds doable. I think I just need to practice more and remind myself it’s okay to set boundaries.  

[02:50] Riley: Absolutely. Boundaries are your tools for sustainable productivity. To wrap up, what are your top three action items before our next session?  
(Jasmine thinks, then smiles confidently)  
Jasmine: First, I’ll set up a visible timer during my deep work sessions. Second, I’ll add a quick movement or hydration break at mid-morning and mid-afternoon. Third, I’ll practice assertive communication with my team about my focus times.  

[02:55] Riley: Excellent! Those are clear and manageable steps. Remember, progress over perfection. And I’ll send you a Notion template to help track your boundaries and energy levels. How does that sound?  
Jasmine: Perfect, thank you. I feel more focused already.  

[03:00] Riley: Great! Next week, we’ll review how these adjustments are working and explore any obstacles you encounter. Keep celebrating your small wins—they add up. Thanks for today, Jasmine.  
Jasmine: Thank you, Riley. I appreciate the support and practical tips. See you next week!
