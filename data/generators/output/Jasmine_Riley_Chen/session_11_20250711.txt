[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How has your week been? Any wins or surprises since our last session?

[02:03] Jasmine: Hi Riley! Thanks. It’s been good overall. I did manage to set some clearer boundaries between work and family time, which felt really good. But, honestly, I still struggle with sticking to the time blocks when I get caught up in a task.

[02:07] Riley: That’s a big step already—recognizing those boundaries is key. When you say you struggle sticking to the time blocks, what tends to happen? Do you notice particular triggers or patterns?

[02:10] Jasmine: Yeah, I think it’s when I get into a flow state—like, I want to finish this feature or fix this bug—and suddenly hours pass. I lose track of time, and then I feel guilty because I’m not with my baby or I’m working late.

[02:15] Riley: That’s a classic challenge—being so engaged that you lose track of time. It’s great that you notice when it happens. Have you tried any specific strategies to help re-anchor yourself when you realize you’re drifting?

[02:20] Jasmine: I’ve tried setting alarms, but sometimes I ignore them or they don’t go off at the right moment. I also don’t want to be too rigid, because I know sometimes things take longer or unexpected issues come up.

[02:24] Riley: Absolutely, flexibility is important. That’s where your internal cues come in. Maybe we can work on developing a gentle reminder system that respects your flow but also nudges you back when needed. For example, a visual cue in your workspace or a quick check-in routine.

[02:28] Jasmine: I like that idea. Maybe a visual indicator—like a sticky note or a colored card—that signals when it’s time to step away or switch tasks.

[02:32] Riley: Perfect. How about integrating a habit of a quick 2-minute check-in every hour? You could ask yourself, “Am I still aligned with my time boundaries?” This way, it’s proactive rather than reactive.

[02:35] Jasmine: That sounds manageable. I think I could set a timer every hour for that. It might help me stay more aware without feeling nagged.

[02:39] Riley: Great. And speaking of boundaries, last time we discussed communicating your needs assertively with your team. How’s that been going? Any situations where you applied those skills?

[02:42] Jasmine: I did try being clearer about my availability during certain hours, especially in the mornings. My team responded well—they’re more respectful now. But I still find it hard to say no when urgent tasks come up unexpectedly.

[02:45] Riley: That’s understandable, especially in a fast-paced fintech environment. It’s a skill that takes practice. Remember, setting boundaries isn’t just about saying no; it’s about offering solutions or alternatives. For example, you might say, “I can tackle this after 3 PM or tomorrow morning.”

[02:50] Jasmine: That’s helpful. I think framing it that way makes it easier to communicate without feeling guilty. I’ll try that next time.

[02:53] Riley: Excellent. Now, let’s talk about energy management. You mentioned juggling work and motherhood can be draining. Have you noticed specific times of day when your energy dips?

[02:55] Jasmine: Yes, definitely in the early afternoon. I get a slump after lunch, especially if I didn’t sleep well the night before.

[02:59] Riley: That’s common. One approach is to schedule lighter tasks or breaks during that time. Also, small self-care activities—like a quick walk or hydration—can boost your energy. Have you tried any strategies to optimize your energy around those times?

[03:03] Jasmine: I’ve started taking short walks outside, which helps a bit. But I haven’t really adjusted my schedule to match my natural energy dips.

[03:07] Riley: That’s a smart move. We can work on mapping your energy levels throughout the day and adjusting your schedule accordingly. Using your calendar for time blocking, you could allocate your most demanding tasks when your energy is higher and reserve lighter tasks for the slump.

[03:11] Jasmine: I like that idea. It makes sense to work with my natural rhythms rather than against them.

[03:15] Riley: Exactly. Also, since your mornings are more energetic, perhaps you can tackle the most complex feature work then, and save meetings or administrative tasks for the afternoon.

[03:18] Jasmine: That’s a good plan. I’ll try to reorganize my schedule next week based on that.

[03:22] Riley: Sounds great. Before we wrap up, let’s set some action items. First, implement the hourly check-in habit with a visual cue. Second, practice assertive boundary setting with your team, offering alternatives. And third, adjust your schedule to match your energy peaks and dips.

[03:27] Jasmine: Perfect. I’ll also keep tracking my energy and boundary-setting progress. Thanks, Riley; I feel more focused now.

[03:30] Riley: Awesome progress, Jasmine. I’m glad you’re feeling clearer. Next session, we’ll review how these strategies are working and explore any new challenges. Sound good?

[03:33] Jasmine: Yes, looking forward to it. Thanks again!

[03:35] Riley: You’re welcome! Have a great week, Jasmine. Talk soon!
