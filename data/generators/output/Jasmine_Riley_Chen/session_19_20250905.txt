[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How’s your week been since our last session? Any wins or surprises?  
(Jasmine smiles warmly, settling in)  

Jasmine: Hi Riley! Thanks. It’s been a busy but good week. I managed to set some clearer boundaries with my team about my work hours, so that’s a win. But I still feel like I’m juggling a lot, especially with my energy levels.  

[02:10] Riley: That’s a fantastic start—really proud of you for establishing those boundaries. Boundaries can be tricky, especially when you’re balancing work and family. How did it feel to communicate that to your team?  

Jasmine: Honestly, a bit uncomfortable at first. I worry about coming across as uncooperative, even though I know I need that space to recharge. But I was firm and clear, and they seemed to respect it.  

Riley: That’s a big step—assertive communication is key. Remember, setting boundaries isn’t just about protecting your time; it’s about respecting your own needs so you can show up effectively in both work and family. How did you feel afterward?  

Jasmine: Relieved, actually. It’s like I finally took control of a small part of my day. But then, I notice I sometimes slip back into overworking when deadlines loom.  

[02:20] Riley: That’s pretty common, especially when deadlines are tight. Have you been using your time blocking and priority mapping since our last session?  

Jasmine: Yes, I’ve been trying to stick with the Notion templates we set up. I block out specific work times, and I try to keep the evenings reserved for family. But I notice that during crunch times, I tend to abandon those blocks and just work until I’m exhausted.  

Riley: That’s a great observation. The key is to build in some flexibility and self-compassion for those crunch moments. Let’s think about how to reinforce your boundaries during those times—maybe with quick rituals or cues that signal ‘work mode’ versus ‘family mode.’  

Jasmine: That makes sense. I’ve been thinking about a small ritual like turning off my work notifications and closing my laptop at a certain time. But I struggle with sticking to it when the pressure’s high.  

[02:30] Riley: It’s all about consistency and making those rituals non-negotiable. Perhaps we can gamify this a bit—like earning points for successfully closing out work at your designated time, which can then be traded for a reward you value. Would that motivate you?  

Jasmine: I like that idea! It would make it feel more like a game rather than another rule I have to follow. Plus, I enjoy tracking progress.  

Riley: Perfect. And speaking of tracking, how’s your energy management been? Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that drain or boost your energy, especially with your new role as a mom?  

Jasmine: Yes, it’s a mixed bag. My mornings are usually good—I get some focused work before the baby wakes up. But by late afternoon, I feel wiped out, especially if I’ve been on screens a lot. I’ve started incorporating quick movement breaks and some breathing exercises, which helps a bit.  

[02:40] Riley: That’s excellent. Small activity breaks and breathing can really reset your energy. Have you thought about structuring your day to align your high-energy tasks with your mornings, and reserve lighter or more flexible tasks for the afternoons?  

Jasmine: I’ve been meaning to do that, but I haven’t quite nailed down how to organize it systematically. I think I need a clearer plan or maybe a visual schedule.  

Riley: Let’s create a simple visual energy and task map this week—using your Notion board—to guide your daily flow. It can include time blocks for high-focus work, family, self-care, and rest. How does that sound?  

Jasmine: That sounds very helpful. I think having a visual reminder would make it easier to stick to the plan.  

[02:50] Riley: Great. So, to recap today’s action items:  
- Finalize and implement your boundary ritual—turning off work notifications at a set time, with a reward system to gamify it.  
- Set up your visual energy-task map in Notion to align tasks with your energy patterns.  
- Continue practicing your breathing and movement breaks, especially during the afternoon slump.  

Also, next week, I’d like us to review how those rituals and the visual schedule are working, and tweak as needed. Does that feel manageable?  

Jasmine: Yes, definitely. I’m excited to try the gamification and see how it helps me stay firm on my boundaries. It feels like a good way to stay motivated.  

Riley: Awesome. And remember, progress isn’t linear—some days will be easier than others. Celebrate the wins, no matter how small. You’re doing great, Jasmine.  

Jasmine: Thank you, Riley. I really appreciate your support and the playful approach—it makes these changes feel less overwhelming.  

Riley: That’s what I’m here for! Looking forward to hearing about your successes next week. Have a wonderful week ahead, Jasmine.  

Jasmine: Thanks, you too! Talk soon.  

[03:00] Riley: Bye for now!
