[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How was your week? Any wins or surprises since our last session?

[02:02] Jasmine: Hi Riley! Yeah, it’s been a busy one, but I think I managed to set some better boundaries. I actually started blocking out specific times for work and family on my calendar, which felt really good.

[02:04] Riley: That’s fantastic! I remember you mentioning last time that boundary-setting felt tricky—so seeing you take concrete steps like calendar blocking is a big win. How did it feel to implement that?

[02:06] Jasmine: Honestly, at first it was a little awkward, especially telling my team I’d be off during certain hours. But I noticed I was less stressed because I wasn’t constantly checking my Slack or feeling guilty about not replying immediately.

[02:08] Riley: That’s a huge shift. It shows you’re starting to reclaim your time. Did you notice any impact on your energy levels or focus during work hours?

[02:10] Jasmine: Yeah, I did! I felt more focused during my dedicated work blocks. And I also managed to get some quick walks in with the baby during my breaks, which helped me reset.

[02:12] Riley: Excellent. Incorporating movement is such a good energy booster—especially with a little one around. How about your family time? Any changes there?

[02:14] Jasmine: I’ve been more intentional about putting my phone away when I’m with my family. I think that’s helped me be more present. Plus, my partner complimented how relaxed I seemed over dinner.

[02:16] Riley: That’s wonderful! Being present really enhances those moments. Now, considering your goals around work-life boundaries and energy management, what do you feel is still challenging?

[02:18] Jasmine: Honestly, I still struggle with feeling guilty when I step away from work, even with the boundaries in place. Sometimes I worry I’m falling behind or not being a "good enough" engineer.

[02:20] Riley: Guilt is a common feeling when setting boundaries, especially in demanding fields like tech. How do you usually handle those feelings?

[02:22] Jasmine: I try to remind myself that taking care of my well-being actually makes me more effective. But it’s still hard to shake that nagging voice sometimes.

[02:24] Riley: That’s a very mature insight—your well-being does fuel your productivity. Let’s explore some techniques today to reinforce that mindset and manage guilt when it arises. Does that sound good?

[02:26] Jasmine: Yes, I’d love that.

[02:27] Riley: Great. Before we dive into strategies, I want to check in on your habit tracking from last week. How did you do with your morning routine?

[02:29] Jasmine: Pretty good! I managed to do a quick meditation and some stretching most mornings. It’s become a small but meaningful part of starting my day.

[02:31] Riley: That’s a solid win. Small routines like that can have big impacts. And how about your evening wind-down? Any progress there?

[02:33] Jasmine: I’ve been trying to avoid screens at least 30 minutes before bed, but honestly, I still slip sometimes when I get caught up in work emails.

[02:35] Riley: That’s understandable. It’s a common challenge. Maybe we can work on a specific ritual to help you disconnect—something that signals the end of your workday. Like a quick journaling session or a relaxing activity?

[02:37] Jasmine: I like the idea of journaling. I think writing down what I accomplished and what’s next could help me feel more organized and ready to disconnect.

[02:39] Riley: Perfect. Let’s build that into your evening routine. Now, going back to boundaries—have you thought about how to communicate your limits more assertively with your team and manager?

[02:41] Jasmine: A bit. I’m worried about how to phrase it without sounding defensive or like I’m not committed.

[02:43] Riley: That’s a common concern. One approach is to frame it around your goals for maintaining high-quality work and sustainability. For example, you could say, “To ensure I deliver my best work, I’m setting specific hours for focused work and availability. I appreciate your understanding as I implement this.” How does that feel?

[02:45] Jasmine: That sounds professional and positive. I think I can try that next time I need to reinforce my boundaries.

[02:47] Riley: Excellent. Remember, consistency is key. Now, about energy management—what’s your current approach for handling energy dips during the day?

[02:49] Jasmine: I usually just power through or take a quick coffee break, but I notice that sometimes I get more sluggish later on.

[02:51] Riley: Have you considered incorporating scheduled mini-rests or quick energizers, like stretching or breathing exercises, into your day? They can help sustain your energy levels without the crash.

[02:53] Jasmine: I like that. I could set reminders for a few minutes of stretching or deep breathing every couple of hours.

[02:55] Riley: Great idea. Let’s also explore how to better plan your work sprints around your natural energy peaks and valleys. Do you notice certain times of day when you’re more alert?

[02:57] Jasmine: I think I’m most productive in the late morning, around 10 to 12. Afternoons tend to be more sluggish, especially after lunch.

[02:59] Riley: Perfect. Use that window for your most demanding tasks, and schedule lighter or administrative work for the afternoon. That way, you’re aligning your tasks with your energy rhythm.

[03:01] Jasmine: That makes sense. I’ll start experimenting with that.

[03:02] Riley: Excellent. To wrap up today, let’s set some clear action items. First, continue with your calendar blocking and boundary communication. Second, add a calming ritual to your evening routine—perhaps journaling or a brief meditation. Third, schedule mini-rests or energizers during your workday.

[03:04] Jasmine: Got it. I’ll also try the framing statement for boundary-setting and experiment with my energy-aware scheduling.

[03:06] Riley: Wonderful. And I’ll follow up on your progress with these strategies in our next session. Anything else you’d like to discuss today?

[03:08] Jasmine: No, I think that covers it for now. Thanks, Riley. I already feel more focused just talking through these plans.

[03:10] Riley: That’s what I love to hear! Remember, progress is a series of small wins. See you next week, Jasmine.

[03:12] Jasmine: Thanks, see you then!
