Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How’s your week been since our last session? Any wins or surprises?

[02:05] Jasmine: Hi Riley! Thanks. It’s been a busy week, but I think I’m starting to get a better handle on balancing work and home. I managed to set some boundaries with my team about my availability, which felt really good.

[02:10] Riley: That’s fantastic! Boundary setting is always a big step. Can you tell me more about how you communicated those boundaries? Was it challenging at all?

[02:15] Jasmine: Well, I sent a Slack message letting them know I’d be offline after 6 p.m. and wouldn’t be checking work emails during family time. It was a bit nerve-wracking to be so firm, but I did it.

[02:20] Riley: Awesome! That’s a clear, assertive move. How did your team respond?

[02:25] Jasmine: They were pretty understanding. My manager even said it’s good for productivity and mental health. I think I felt more confident after that.

[02:30] Riley: That’s a great example of setting boundaries that support both your work and family life. How are you feeling emotionally about maintaining these boundaries? Any worries?

[02:35] Jasmine: A little. I worry I might miss out on urgent updates or that I’ll be seen as less committed. But I also really want to protect my evenings for my baby and myself.

[02:40] Riley: It’s natural to have those worries. Remember, setting boundaries actually helps you show up more focused and energized during work hours, which benefits everyone. We can work on some strategies to reinforce your boundaries and manage any feelings of FOMO.

[02:45] Jasmine: That sounds good. I’ve also been trying to use time blocking more intentionally, especially during my workday. I block out specific periods for deep work and breaks.

[02:50] Riley: Excellent! How’s that been going? Any particular successes or hiccups?

[02:55] Jasmine: The deep work blocks work well, but I sometimes get interrupted by family needs or last-minute requests. I find it hard to stick strictly to the schedule.

[03:00] Riley: That’s quite common, especially with a little one. Let’s think about how to build flexibility into your time blocks without losing structure. Maybe some buffer periods or quick reset routines?

[03:05] Jasmine: Yeah, I think I need to plan for unexpected interruptions. Also, I want to improve how I transition between work and family—sometimes I feel like I’m still in work mode when I’m with my baby.

[03:10] Riley: Transitioning is key. Have you tried any specific rituals or cues to signal the switch from work to family time?

[03:15] Jasmine: Not really. I usually just shut my laptop, but I don’t do anything special afterward.

[03:20] Riley: That’s a good start, but adding a small ritual—like a quick breathing exercise, a walk, or even changing clothes—can help reinforce the boundary. Would you like to try implementing a simple end-of-work ritual this week?

[03:25] Jasmine: Yeah, I’d like that. Maybe a quick 2-minute stretch or breathing exercise.

[03:30] Riley: Perfect. It’s small but effective. Now, thinking about energy management—how are you feeling in terms of energy levels throughout the day? Any patterns?

[03:35] Jasmine: I tend to crash in the late afternoon, especially after a busy morning. I’m trying to nap when I can, but sometimes I push through.

[03:40] Riley: Naps are great if they work for you. Have you considered scheduling a short energy boost break—like a quick walk or some stretching—around that time to re-energize?

[03:45] Jasmine: I like that idea. I think I often forget to take those breaks, thinking I should just push through.

[03:50] Riley: That’s common, but those small breaks can make a big difference. Also, if you can, plan lighter or more creative tasks for that post-lunch slump period to match your energy.

[03:55] Jasmine: That makes sense. I’ll try to structure my day that way. Speaking of work tasks, I’ve been using my Notion templates but sometimes struggle with prioritization. I get overwhelmed with everything on my plate.

[04:00] Riley: Prioritization can be tough, especially with tight deadlines. Have you tried mapping your tasks onto a priority matrix or using a system like Eisenhower’s to distinguish urgent versus important?

[04:05] Jasmine: Not systematically. I usually just make a list and pick what seems most urgent.

[04:10] Riley: Let’s set up a simple process this week—perhaps a weekly review where you categorize tasks into four quadrants. This can help you focus on what truly moves the needle and delegate or delay the rest.

[04:15] Jasmine: That sounds helpful. I think I need that extra clarity.

[04:20] Riley: Great! We’ll build that into your system. Before we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress you’re making with these boundaries and routines?

[04:25] Jasmine: I feel more in control, honestly. It’s like I’m starting to reclaim some of my time and energy, which is a relief.

[04:30] Riley: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, change is gradual, and you’re doing fantastic. For next week, let’s focus on implementing that end-of-work ritual, refining your energy break, and trying out the prioritization method.

[04:35] Jasmine: Sounds good. I’ll also keep practicing the boundary setting and see how it goes.

[04:40] Riley: Perfect. And feel free to reach out if anything comes up before our next session. Keep celebrating those wins—big or small!

[04:45] Jasmine: Will do. Thanks so much, Riley. This session really helped clarify my next steps.

[04:50] Riley: My pleasure, Jasmine. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a great rest of your day and enjoy that quality time with your baby!

[04:50] Jasmine: Thanks, you too! Bye!
