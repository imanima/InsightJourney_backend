[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
(Jasmine smiles softly, a little tired but attentive)  
Jasmine: Hi Riley. Honestly, a bit overwhelmed, but excited to get some clarity today. It's been a busy week with the baby and work deadlines.  

[02:05] Riley: I hear you. It’s a lot to juggle. Last time, we talked about establishing clearer boundaries between work and family time. How has that been going?  
Jasmine: I’ve tried to set specific work hours, but sometimes I find myself checking emails after hours or responding to messages. It’s hard to switch off completely.  

[02:10] Riley: That’s completely understandable, especially when you're working remotely and love what you do. Let’s explore some strategies to make boundary-setting more automatic. Have you considered using time blocks that include "family mode" and "work mode"?  
Jasmine: I’ve thought about it, but I haven’t quite figured out how to stick to them when urgent stuff comes up.  

[02:15] Riley: Good point. Urgent tasks can derail plans. One way is to build in buffer periods—say, a 15-minute transition time between work and family blocks. Also, communicating these blocks clearly to your team helps set expectations. How does that sound?  
Jasmine: That makes sense. I think if I can communicate better, I won’t feel so guilty about stepping away. Sometimes I worry about missing out on important updates.  

[02:20] Riley: That’s a common concern. Would it help to set specific times for checking emails and messages—say, twice a day—so you can focus fully during your work blocks?  
Jasmine: Yes, I like that. It would reduce the constant checking and help me be more present.  

[02:25] Riley: Excellent. Now, since energy management is also a challenge, have you noticed particular times of day when your energy dips, especially with the baby’s schedule?  
Jasmine: Definitely. Mornings are good, but mid-afternoon I get sleepy, and I struggle to stay focused on deep work.  

[02:30] Riley: That’s normal. We can try to align your most demanding tasks with your high-energy periods, and schedule lighter tasks or breaks during the dips. Have you tried incorporating quick energizing routines, like stretching or a short walk?  
Jasmine: Not consistently. I usually just try to power through.  

[02:35] Riley: Let’s set a small goal—this week, try a 5-minute stretch or walk when you notice your energy dropping. We’ll track how that impacts your focus and mood. How does that sound?  
Jasmine: I can do that. It might help me feel less sluggish and more in control.  

[02:40] Riley: Perfect. Now, earlier you mentioned feeling guilty about stepping away sometimes. How comfortable are you asserting your boundaries with your team or manager?  
Jasmine: I think I could be better at saying no or setting clearer expectations, but I worry about coming off as uncooperative.  

[02:45] Riley: That’s a common concern. Remember, assertiveness is about clear, respectful communication. You can frame boundaries as prioritizing your work quality and mental health—both benefit from boundaries. Would you like to role-play a boundary-setting phrase you could use?  
Jasmine: Yeah, that would help.  

[02:50] Riley: Okay, imagine someone asks you to handle an urgent task after hours. You could say, “I want to help, but I’ve set specific work hours to ensure I stay productive and balanced. I’ll be happy to look into this first thing tomorrow during my work time.” How does that sound?  
Jasmine: That sounds firm but polite. I think I could practice that.  

[02:55] Riley: Great! Practice makes perfect. To wrap up, let’s review your action items:  
- Implement time blocks for work and family, with buffer periods.  
- Limit email checking to twice daily.  
- Incorporate quick energizing routines during energy dips.  
- Practice assertive boundary-setting phrases.  

And for next session, I’d like you to reflect on how these strategies feel and any adjustments needed. Does that work?  
Jasmine: Yes, I feel more confident already. Thanks, Riley.  

[03:00] Riley: You’re welcome! I’m proud of your progress. We’ll check in on these next week. Have a great rest of your day, Jasmine, and take good care of yourself and your family.  
Jasmine: Thanks, you too! Bye.
