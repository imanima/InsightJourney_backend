[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Glad we’re back together. How are you feeling today? Any wins or challenges since our last session?

[02:05] Jasmine: Hey Riley. I’m feeling okay, I think. I managed to finish the sprint deadline last week—finally! It felt like a big win. But honestly, I still struggle with setting clear boundaries between work and family time.

[02:07] Riley: That’s great to hear about the deadline—congratulations! And I hear you; boundary-setting can be tricky, especially with a little one in the mix. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening around boundaries lately?

[02:10] Jasmine: Well, I often find myself answering emails after hours, or just working into the evening because I think I need to catch up. But then I feel guilty about not spending enough quality time with my baby or partner.

[02:13] Riley: That’s a common challenge, especially when work blurs into personal time. Let’s explore some practical steps you can take to reinforce those boundaries. Have you tried any specific time blocking or setting ‘office hours’ for yourself?

[02:15] Jasmine: I’ve thought about it, but I haven’t been consistent. I tried to block out 9 to 5, but I keep getting pulled into tasks or answering messages after hours. I guess I need a better system.

[02:17] Riley: Absolutely. Consistency is key. How about we revisit your current schedule and see where we can implement clear, non-negotiable work blocks? Maybe even using visual cues or alarms to signify ‘work time’ vs. ‘family time’?

[02:20] Jasmine: That sounds good. I think I could use alarms or notifications—something that reminds me when my work window ends.

[02:22] Riley: Great idea. We can set up a digital timer or an app that signals when your work hours are over. Also, do you remember our previous discussion about creating a ‘shutdown ritual’ at the end of your workday? How has that been going?

[02:25] Jasmine: Honestly, I’ve been a bit inconsistent with that. Sometimes I forget or just keep working because I think I’ll catch up. But I do notice that I feel more relaxed when I do have a clear ending point.

[02:27] Riley: That’s a valuable insight. Establishing a reliable shutdown ritual—like closing your laptop, turning off notifications, or a short mindfulness exercise—can signal to your brain that work is done. Would you like to design a simple ritual together now?

[02:30] Jasmine: Yes, I’d like that. Maybe I can do a quick review of what I accomplished, then turn off my devices, and do a five-minute breathing exercise?

[02:32] Riley: Perfect. Let’s make it a routine: after your last task, do a quick reflection—what you completed, what’s pending—and then execute your shutdown. I’ll help you set a reminder for that. Now, how does that sound?

[02:35] Jasmine: That sounds doable. I think it’ll help me feel more in control and clear about when work ends.

[02:37] Riley: Excellent. Moving on, how are you managing your energy levels throughout the day? Any patterns or signals you notice?

[02:40] Jasmine: Well, I tend to get a big energy dip after lunch, especially when I try to work with the baby nearby. Sometimes I get distracted, and my focus drops.

[02:43] Riley: That’s a great observation. Energy dips are common, especially with new motherhood. One approach is to schedule lighter tasks during those times or incorporate small energy boosters—like a quick stretch, hydration, or a brief walk outside.

[02:45] Jasmine: I like the idea of using that low-energy period for less demanding tasks. Maybe I can also experiment with switching to more engaging tasks when I feel most alert.

[02:48] Riley: Exactly. Also, have you considered using a time management technique like the Pomodoro method? Short, focused intervals could help manage your energy better and reduce burnout.

[02:50] Jasmine: I’ve heard of it but haven’t tried it yet. Do you think that would work alongside my current tools?

[02:52] Riley: Definitely. You can set a timer for 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. It can help you stay engaged without overexerting. Plus, it’s great for managing interruptions when your baby needs attention.

[02:55] Jasmine: That sounds promising. I’ll give it a try this week. Do you recommend any apps for that?

[02:57] Riley: There are many free options—Focus Booster, Be Focused, or even simple timers on your phone. We can look into one that integrates well with your workflow.

[03:00] Jasmine: Perfect. Moving a bit to work-life boundaries—how do I communicate my new boundaries to my team without feeling guilty or risking my reputation?

[03:03] Riley: Setting boundaries assertively is key. You might say, “I’m focusing on deep work during these hours and will respond to non-urgent messages afterward.” Framing it positively helps others respect your time without feeling dismissed.

[03:05] Jasmine: That makes sense. I think I can practice that—being clear and firm but polite.

[03:08] Riley: Great. Remember, consistency reinforces those boundaries. Over time, your colleagues will adapt. Also, consider sharing your schedule with your team so they know when you’re available.

[03:10] Jasmine: I like that. It might help set expectations upfront.

[03:12] Riley: Absolutely. Now, looking ahead, what’s one thing you want to focus on before our next session?

[03:15] Jasmine: I want to set up my work and family boundaries more clearly, including my shutdown ritual and scheduled work hours. I’ll also try the Pomodoro technique during my low-energy times.

[03:17] Riley: That’s a solid plan. I’ll send you a quick summary of these strategies and some templates to get started. How does that sound?

[03:20] Jasmine: Perfect. Thanks, Riley. I already feel more equipped to tackle these challenges.

[03:22] Riley: Glad to hear it! Remember, progress is about small steps—celebrate each win. I look forward to hearing how it goes next week.

[03:25] Jasmine: Will do. Thanks again for your support today.

[03:27] Riley: Anytime. See you next week, Jasmine!
