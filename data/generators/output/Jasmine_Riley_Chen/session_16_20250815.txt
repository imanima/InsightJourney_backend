Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How has your week been? Anything new or noteworthy since our last session?

[02:03] Jasmine: Hi Riley. Thanks. It's been a busy week, as usual. I feel like I did okay managing my work deadlines, but I'm still struggling with balancing everything, especially with the baby. Sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed, honestly.

[02:07] Riley: Totally understandable, Jasmine. Juggling work and a new baby is a big challenge. Remember, our goal is to create systems that help you feel more in control, not perfect. Last time, we talked about setting clearer boundaries around your work hours. How has that been going?

[02:10] Jasmine: Well, I tried to stick to a schedule—logging off at 6 PM sharp. But sometimes I find myself checking emails after hours or finishing small tasks, which eats into family time.

[02:13] Riley: That’s a common slip, especially when you’re motivated to stay on top of things. How about we explore some specific strategies today to reinforce those boundaries? Maybe some quick wins to help you feel more confident in disconnecting?

[02:17] Jasmine: Yeah, I’d like that. I think I need concrete steps to make it easier, especially when I’m tempted to keep working.

[02:20] Riley: Great. Let’s start by reviewing your current schedule. Do you use time blocking during your workday?

[02:23] Jasmine: I do, but sometimes I get pulled into tasks outside of my blocks—urgent emails or quick fixes that turn into longer sessions.

[02:27] Riley: That’s understandable. How about we implement stricter time blocks, with built-in buffer periods for those unexpected tasks? Plus, a visual cue—like an alarm or a status indicator—to signal when your work time is over?

[02:30] Jasmine: I like the idea of alarms. I could set a reminder on my phone to signal when I should start wrapping up.

[02:33] Riley: Perfect. Also, have you thought about a closing ritual? Something that signals the end of your workday, like tidying your workspace or a quick review of tomorrow’s priorities?

[02:36] Jasmine: Hmm, I like that. Maybe I can spend five minutes organizing my desk and reviewing my tasks for tomorrow. That might help me mentally switch off.

[02:39] Riley: Exactly. Rituals like that can reinforce boundaries. And what about your after-hours habits? Do you have a way to disconnect from work devices?

[02:42] Jasmine: Not consistently. Sometimes I leave my laptop open, and then I get tempted to check things.

[02:45] Riley: Let’s build a simple rule: no work devices after a certain time—say, 6:30 PM. Maybe you can place your laptop in a different room or turn it off to create a physical barrier.

[02:48] Jasmine: That makes sense. I think I’ll try that. It might help me avoid the temptation.

[02:50] Riley: Great. Now, shifting gears a bit—how are you doing with energy management? Have you noticed any patterns in when you feel most productive or drained?

[02:53] Jasmine: I tend to have more energy in the mornings, but after lunch, I get sluggish, especially when I try to work with the baby during naps.

[02:57] Riley: That’s a valuable insight. We can leverage your high-energy mornings for your most demanding tasks. And perhaps schedule lighter or more routine tasks for the afternoons when your energy dips.

[03:00] Jasmine: Yeah, I could do that. Maybe I can batch my coding tasks for the mornings and use afternoons for meetings or administrative stuff.

[03:03] Riley: That’s a solid plan. Also, integrating short energizer breaks during the day can help maintain your focus. Have you tried quick movement or mindfulness exercises?

[03:07] Jasmine: Not regularly, no. I usually just keep working.

[03:10] Riley: Incorporating a five-minute stretch or a brief mindfulness session can boost your energy and focus. I can send you some resources if you'd like.

[03:13] Jasmine: That would be helpful. Thanks.

[03:15] Riley: You're welcome. Now, regarding your work-life balance, how comfortable are you with communicating your boundaries to your team?

[03:18] Jasmine: I think I could be more assertive. Sometimes I hesitate to set limits, especially with deadlines looming.

[03:22] Riley: Practice makes perfect. Small, clear communications can make a big difference. For example, letting your team know your working hours upfront or using an out-of-office message after hours.

[03:25] Jasmine: I could do that. I also want to be more honest about my capacity without feeling guilty.

[03:28] Riley: That’s a healthy mindset. Remember, setting boundaries is about respecting your time and energy so you can show up fully both at work and with your family. How do you feel about trying a simple boundary-setting statement this week?

[03:32] Jasmine: I can try saying, “I’ll be offline after 6:30, but I’ll check in first thing tomorrow,” when colleagues ask for late updates.

[03:36] Riley: Excellent. It’s clear, respectful, and sets expectations. Keep track of how it feels and any reactions you get.

[03:39] Jasmine: Will do. Overall, I think these strategies will help me feel less overwhelmed.

[03:42] Riley: That’s the goal. Before we wrap up, let’s set a couple of action items. First, implement the end-of-day ritual and the device boundaries. Second, schedule your high-energy tasks in the mornings and lighter tasks in the afternoons. And third, practice your boundary statement with colleagues.

[03:45] Jasmine: Sounds good. I’ll start with these this week.

[03:48] Riley: Perfect. And next time, we can review how these changes are working, tweak as needed, and explore any new challenges. How does that sound?

[03:50] Jasmine: That sounds great. Thanks, Riley. I feel more hopeful about managing things now.

[03:52] Riley: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is a process, and you’re doing really well. See you next week!

[03:55] Jasmine: Thanks! See you then.
