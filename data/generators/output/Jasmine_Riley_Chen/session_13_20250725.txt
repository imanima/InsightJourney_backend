[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any highlights or surprises this week?  
(Jasmine takes a deep breath, smiling slightly)  

[02:05] Jasmine: Hey Riley. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I managed to set some boundaries around work hours, but I still feel like I’m juggling a lot—especially with my energy levels. The baby’s been extra active lately, and I’m trying to keep up.  

[02:10] Riley: That’s a big achievement already—setting those boundaries! It’s totally normal to feel a bit overwhelmed with a new rhythm, especially juggling work and motherhood. What’s been working well for you?  

[02:15] Jasmine: I’ve been trying to block out specific times for work and family, you know, using my calendar more intentionally. But sometimes, I find myself slipping into work mode outside those hours or feeling guilty when I take a break.  

[02:20] Riley: That’s a common challenge, and it’s great you’re using time blocking—an excellent step! Guilt can be tricky, but remember, boundaries are about protecting your energy so you can be fully present in both roles. Have you noticed any particular triggers that make it harder to stick to those blocks?  

[02:25] Jasmine: Usually, when a deadline approaches or I get distracted by a new feature idea for work. Or when the baby wakes up unexpectedly—then I feel torn between finishing a task and comforting her.  

[02:30] Riley: Those are real moments, and they show how much you’re balancing. How about we explore some quick strategies to handle those unexpected interruptions? Maybe a flexible buffer in your schedule or a quick reset routine?  

[02:35] Jasmine: That sounds helpful. I think having some built-in flexibility might reduce the guilt when things don’t go perfectly. Also, I want to get better at switching gears without losing track of time.  

[02:40] Riley: Perfect. Let’s talk about implementing a “transition ritual”—something simple like a 5-minute breathing exercise or a quick stretch to signal the shift from work to family mode. Have you tried anything like that before?  

[02:45] Jasmine: Not really, but I like the idea. Sometimes I just rush from one to the other without stopping, which makes me feel more frantic.  

[02:50] Riley: That’s a common pattern. Creating intentional transitions can help you reset and be more present wherever you are. Let’s set a goal for this week: try a transition ritual at least three times a day, and note how it affects your energy and mood. Sound good?  

[02:55] Jasmine: Yes, I can do that. It feels manageable. Also, I’ve been thinking about how to better use my mornings—my energy is usually higher then. Maybe I can plan my most demanding tasks early?  

[03:00] Riley: Absolutely, leveraging your peak energy times is a smart move. We talked about time blocking for priority tasks last time, right? How’s that been going?  

[03:05] Jasmine: It’s been better. I’ve scheduled my deep work sessions in the mornings, and I try to keep afternoons lighter. But sometimes, I get pulled into quick fixes or small errands, which eats into that prime time.  

[03:10] Riley: That’s a common snag—those small tasks can add up. How about creating a “priority map” at the start of each day? List your top 3-4 must-dos and keep them visible. When a distraction pops up, you can remind yourself of those priorities.  

[03:15] Jasmine: I like that. Visual cues really help me stay focused. I could add that to my Notion template.  

[03:20] Riley: Perfect! And remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Sometimes, a quick reset or a reminder can bring you back on track. Now, how are you feeling about your energy management overall? Any signs of burnout or fatigue?  

[03:25] Jasmine: Yeah, I’ve been feeling pretty drained by the end of the day, especially when I try to do some work after I put the baby down. My brain just won’t cooperate sometimes.  

[03:30] Riley: That’s understandable. Self-care is key, especially in a busy season like this. Have you considered setting a “shutdown ritual” at the end of your workday—something that signals the end and helps you transition into family time?  

[03:35] Jasmine: I haven’t, but it sounds useful. Maybe a quick walk or some journaling?  

[03:40] Riley: Both are great options. Even a brief moment to reflect on what you accomplished and what to tackle tomorrow can help clear your mind. Let’s add that to your action plan for next week.  

[03:45] Jasmine: Sounds good. I think I need to be more intentional about closing out my workday so I don’t carry stress into family time.  

[03:50] Riley: Exactly. Now, looking at your long-term goals—maintaining your career growth while managing family—what’s one small step you can take this month to support that?  

[03:55] Jasmine: Maybe scheduling regular check-ins with my team about workload and deadlines, so I can stay ahead and avoid last-minute crunches.  

[04:00] Riley: Excellent idea. Proactive communication can really ease pressure and give you more control. Let’s set a specific goal: schedule at least two team check-ins within the next month.  

[04:05] Jasmine: Will do. And I’ll also keep refining my time blocks and transition rituals. I feel like I’m building a toolkit that really supports me.  

[04:10] Riley: That’s the spirit! Remember, these systems are about making your life easier, not adding stress. We’ll check in on how everything’s going next session. Before we wrap up, any questions or thoughts?  

[04:15] Jasmine: No, I think I’m good for now. Thanks, Riley. I feel more focused and equipped to handle the week ahead.  

[04:20] Riley: Wonderful! I’m proud of your progress. Keep experimenting, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. See you next week, Jasmine!  

[04:25] Jasmine: Thanks! See you next time.
