Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Jasmine (Front-end Engineer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How’s everything been since our last session? Any wins or surprises this week?

Jasmine: Hey Riley! Thanks, I’ve actually had a pretty good week. Managed to stick to my new time blocks for work, and I even set some boundaries with my team about after-hours emails. Felt pretty good about it.

[02:10] Riley: That’s fantastic! Setting those boundaries can be really challenging, especially in a high-pressure role like yours. How did it feel to enforce them? Was there any pushback?

Jasmine: A little, at first. I had to remind my team a couple of times, but overall, they were understanding. I think they’re starting to respect my designated work hours now.

[02:15] Riley: That’s progress! Remember, consistency is key. How are you feeling energy-wise throughout the day? Any noticeable changes with the new boundaries?

Jasmine: Actually, yes. I’m feeling less drained by the end of the day, and I have some energy left for my family. It’s like I’m not running on empty as much.

[02:25] Riley: That’s wonderful to hear. It sounds like the boundary setting is positively impacting your energy management. Have you noticed any specific times when you feel most productive or most drained?

Jasmine: Mornings are usually good—I can get a lot done before lunch. But late afternoons, I tend to hit a wall, especially after feeding the baby or doing chores.

[02:30] Riley: That’s a common pattern, especially with new motherhood. We can look at optimizing your energy during those times. Do you think incorporating short breaks or quick energizers might help?

Jasmine: Possibly. I’ve been trying to push through, but maybe I need to give myself permission to rest briefly instead of ignoring my fatigue.

[02:40] Riley: Absolutely. I often recommend quick reset techniques—like a 5-minute stretch, deep breathing, or a brief walk. Have you tried anything like that?

Jasmine: I’ve done some stretching, but I forget to do it regularly. I could set reminders, maybe in my Notion habit tracker.

[02:45] Riley: Great idea. Consistent cues help build those habits. Speaking of Notion, how’s your current task management system working for balancing work and family priorities?

Jasmine: It’s been helpful. I’ve organized my tasks into different boards—work, home, baby care—and it helps me see everything at a glance. Still, I get overwhelmed sometimes when I see a long list.

[02:55] Riley: That’s understandable. When the list feels overwhelming, do you find it helpful to prioritize or break tasks into smaller chunks?

Jasmine: Yes, I’ve started doing that. I use a simple priority system—urgent, important, can wait—and break large tasks into steps. It’s making things feel more manageable.

[03:05] Riley: Excellent. It sounds like you’re developing a strong system. How do you feel about your ability to switch between roles—engineer, mom, partner—without losing focus or feeling guilty?

Jasmine: It’s still a challenge. Sometimes I feel guilty stepping away from work when my baby needs me, but I know I need that balance. I’ve been trying to remind myself that taking care of myself and my family actually helps my work too.

[03:15] Riley: That’s a healthy mindset. Remember, boundaries aren’t just about time—they’re about mental space too. Have you thought about specific ways to communicate your boundaries assertively, especially with your team or family?

Jasmine: I think I can be clearer about my work hours and when I’m available for calls or meetings. I want to avoid last-minute expectations, especially during my family time.

[03:25] Riley: That’s a strong strategy. Role-playing or scripting some of those conversations can make you feel more confident. Would you like to practice a quick assertive script now?

Jasmine: Sure, that would be helpful.

[03:30] Riley: Great. Imagine you’re telling a team member you’re unavailable after 6 PM. You might say, “Thanks for reaching out. I’m wrapping up for the day and won’t be responding to emails after 6. If it’s urgent, please mark it as such, and I’ll get to it tomorrow.” How does that feel?

Jasmine: That sounds clear and respectful. I like the part about marking it as urgent. I think I can do that.

[03:40] Riley: Perfect. Practice makes perfect. Remember, consistent communication reinforces your boundaries and helps others respect them. How about next week, we focus on refining your schedule for that late afternoon energy dip, maybe experimenting with specific energizers or adjustments?

Jasmine: Yes, I’d like that. I want to see if I can improve my productivity during those hours without feeling burnt out.

[03:50] Riley: Sounds like a solid plan. Before we wrap up today, what’s one small action step you’re committing to before our next session?

Jasmine: I’ll set reminders in Notion for quick breaks and try out the assertive boundary script with my team if needed.

[03:55] Riley: Excellent. Keep track of how that feels and any shifts you notice. We’ll review and adjust as needed next time. Any final thoughts or questions before we finish?

Jasmine: Just that I appreciate the focus on balancing everything. It feels more doable with these structured steps.

Riley: That’s the goal—making it manageable and sustainable. You’re making great progress, Jasmine. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll keep building on this momentum.

Jasmine: Thanks, Riley. See you then!

[04:00] Riley: Take care!
