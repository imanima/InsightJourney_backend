Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley Chen: Hi Jasmine! It’s so good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any wins or surprises this week?

[02:02] Jasmine: Hey Riley. Yeah, I’ve been okay. I think I managed to stick to my new work boundaries most days. It’s still a bit tricky, but I feel like I’m getting better at saying no when things spill over into family time.

[02:05] Riley: That’s great to hear! Boundary setting is definitely a skill, and it’s all about practice. What specific strategies did you use this week to protect your time?

[02:07] Jasmine: Well, I started using the time blocks we set up—like, I block out 9 to 11 for deep work, and then I make sure I turn off notifications after that. Also, I communicated my schedule more clearly to my team, which helped.

[02:10] Riley: Nice! Using those blocks is a solid step. How did it feel to communicate your boundaries more assertively? Any feedback from your team?

[02:12] Jasmine: Actually, yes. They’re a bit more mindful now, and I feel more confident saying, “I’ll get back to you after my deep work session.” It’s a small change, but it makes a difference.

[02:15] Riley: Absolutely, those small shifts add up. How about your energy levels throughout the day? Any patterns or moments when you feel more drained or energized?

[02:17] Jasmine: Hmm, I notice I get pretty drained after lunch, especially if I don’t step away or do some quick movement. I’ve been trying to do 5-minute stretches, and it helps a bit.

[02:20] Riley: That’s a smart move—short, intentional breaks can really boost energy. Have you considered integrating more active routines into your day, maybe a quick walk or some breathing exercises?

[02:22] Jasmine: Yeah, I’ve thought about a quick walk outside, especially now that the weather’s still nice. I just need to remember to do it.

[02:25] Riley: Setting a reminder or linking it to a specific time, like immediately after lunch, could help automate that. Remember, consistency is key. Now, thinking about work-life boundaries, how are you feeling about balancing your role as a mom and your job?

[02:27] Jasmine: It’s still a work in progress. I sometimes feel guilty stepping away from work when my baby needs me, even if I’ve scheduled that time. But I also know I need those boundaries to stay sane and productive.

[02:30] Riley: That’s a common feeling, Jasmine. It’s about redefining those boundaries as a form of self-care, not guilt. Have you tried communicating your availability to your team and family in a way that feels firm yet compassionate?

[02:32] Jasmine: I did. I told my team I’m unavailable during certain blocks, and I set clear expectations with my partner about my work hours. It’s helping, but I still catch myself checking emails outside designated times.

[02:35] Riley: That’s normal—digital boundaries can be tough. Maybe you can create a "tech curfew" for yourself, like turning off work devices after a certain hour. Would that feel manageable?

[02:37] Jasmine: Yeah, I think I can try that. It might help me disconnect and be more present with my family.

[02:40] Riley: Excellent. Now, looking back over the last few months, what do you think has been your biggest growth area?

[02:42] Jasmine: Honestly, it’s been learning to say no and protect my time. I used to feel guilty for setting boundaries, but now I see it’s necessary for my well-being.

[02:45] Riley: That’s a huge milestone. Guilt often comes with boundary setting, but re-framing it as taking care of yourself is powerful. How about your task management—are your AI tools and Kanban boards still helping you stay on top?

[02:47] Jasmine: Definitely. I love how visual it is. I’ve been breaking down big projects into smaller tasks, which makes everything less overwhelming.

[02:50] Riley: That’s fantastic. Small wins build momentum. Do you want to set a new habit or system to focus on before our next session?

[02:52] Jasmine: Maybe I can work on fully unplugging after hours and keeping that tech curfew. Also, I want to try a quick energy check-in mid-afternoon to see how I’m doing.

[02:55] Riley: Great goals. I’ll send you a simple Notion template for a daily energy and mood tracker, which can remind you to do that quick check. How does that sound?

[02:57] Jasmine: Perfect. That’ll help me stay mindful. Thanks, Riley.

[02:59] Riley: My pleasure! Before we wrap up, let’s quickly outline your next steps. You’ll implement the tech curfew, try the energy check-in, and communicate your boundaries clearly to your team and family. Does that sound good?

[03:01] Jasmine: Yes, I feel confident about these steps. Thanks for the support.

[03:03] Riley: Wonderful. I’ll follow up with the tracker template and some tips on tech boundaries. Keep celebrating your progress, Jasmine—you’re doing great. See you next week!

[03:05] Jasmine: Thanks, Riley. See you then!
