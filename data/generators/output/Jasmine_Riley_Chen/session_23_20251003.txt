Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[02:02] Jasmine: Hi Riley. Pretty good, honestly. I’ve been trying to implement some of the time blocking techniques we discussed. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I think I’m getting the hang of it.

[02:05] Riley: That’s fantastic to hear. Remember, it’s all about the small wins. What’s been working well for you so far?

[02:07] Jasmine: Well, I started blocking out specific hours for deep work, especially in the mornings. I also added quick check-ins with my baby between tasks, which helps me reset.

[02:10] Riley: Nice! That’s a smart way to integrate family into your routine without losing focus. How are you feeling about setting boundaries around your work hours?

[02:12] Jasmine: Honestly, it’s still a work in progress. I find it hard to say no when urgent tasks come up, especially when I see my team needs support. But I’ve started practicing more assertive communication—like, politely but firmly clarifying my work hours.

[02:15] Riley: That’s a great step. Remember, setting boundaries is a muscle—so the more you practice, the stronger it gets. Have you noticed any particular time of day when your energy dips?

[02:17] Jasmine: Definitely in the late afternoon. I feel my concentration waning, and I get easily distracted. That’s when I tend to jump between tasks or get sidetracked by emails.

[02:20] Riley: That’s common. Have you considered scheduling lighter, more routine tasks during that dip? Maybe some admin or quick reviews, so you conserve your energy for more demanding work earlier in the day?

[02:22] Jasmine: I like that idea. I could batch those tasks together. It might help me stay more focused during prime hours.

[02:25] Riley: Exactly. Plus, using your habit tracker to monitor those energy patterns can give us insights over the next few weeks. Speaking of which, how’s your energy management going overall? Any improvements?

[02:27] Jasmine: I think so. I’ve been better about taking short breaks, especially after intensive coding sessions. I also started a quick stretching routine, which helps with alertness.

[02:30] Riley: That’s excellent. Movement can boost your focus and reduce fatigue. Now, about your work-life boundaries—how’s that aspect progressing?

[02:32] Jasmine: It’s improving, but I still find it tough to fully disconnect after work. I catch myself checking Slack or emails sometimes, even after hours.

[02:35] Riley: That’s a common challenge. Have you set specific 'shutdown' routines? Maybe a ritual that signals the end of your workday, like a short walk or a particular activity?

[02:37] Jasmine: Not consistently, but I like the idea of a 'closing ritual.' Maybe I can do a quick review of what I accomplished and plan for tomorrow, then shut down completely.

[02:40] Riley: Perfect. That can help your brain switch gears and reinforce those boundaries. How does your family time feel? Are you able to fully be present?

[02:42] Jasmine: I think I’m doing better. I set aside dedicated family blocks, especially after work. Sometimes I still feel guilty when I step away from screens, but I remind myself that quality time matters.

[02:45] Riley: Guilt can be tough, but practicing self-compassion is key. Remember, setting intentional boundaries allows you to be more present when you’re with your family.

[02:47] Jasmine: Yeah, I see that more clearly now. I want to keep improving on that front.

[02:50] Riley: Great progress, Jasmine. For next week, I’d like you to try implementing your 'closing ritual' and track how it impacts your energy and boundaries. Also, continue refining your time blocks, especially around your energy dips.

[02:52] Jasmine: Will do. I’ll also note my feelings of guilt or ease during family time to discuss next session.

[02:55] Riley: Fantastic. And remember, small consistent steps lead to lasting change. We’re building a system that works for you. Anything else on your mind today?

[02:57] Jasmine: No, I think that covers everything. Thanks for the guidance; I feel more confident about these adjustments.

[02:59] Riley: I’m glad to hear that. We’ll keep refining as we go. Next session, we can review your new routines and celebrate your wins. See you then!

[03:00] Jasmine: Thanks, Riley. See you next week!
