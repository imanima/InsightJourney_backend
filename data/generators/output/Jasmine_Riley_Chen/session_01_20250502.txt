Session 1/24
Date: May 02, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Jasmine (Front-end Engineer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last check-in? (smiles warmly)

[02:03] Jasmine: Hi Riley! Thanks, I’ve been okay. Definitely some ups and downs, but I’m glad we’re doing this regularly now. It helps keep me on track. (smiles softly)

[02:05] Riley: That’s wonderful to hear. Last time, we talked about establishing clearer boundaries around your work and family time. How has that been going? Any wins or hurdles?

[02:08] Jasmine: Well, I did try to set more firm “work hours” for myself. For example, I started shutting down my laptop at 6:30 PM instead of working late. But sometimes I still feel guilty when I step away, especially when I see a bug or a feature I want to finish.

[02:10] Riley: That’s a common feeling, especially when you’re invested in your work. How does it feel when you manage to step away on time? Do you notice any changes in your energy or mood?

[02:13] Jasmine: Actually, yes. I feel less exhausted and more present with my baby in the evenings. It kind of resets my energy for the next day, even if I don’t get as much done after hours.

[02:15] Riley: That’s a fantastic start. Setting boundaries isn’t just about stopping work — it’s about creating space for yourself and your family. Maybe we can build on that by creating a specific “transition ritual” at the end of your workday? Like a quick review or a mini celebration of what you accomplished?

[02:18] Jasmine: I like that idea. Sometimes I just shut down abruptly, and I think a small ritual would help me feel more intentional about ending my workday.

[02:20] Riley: Great! And speaking of intentionality, last session we discussed using time blocking to manage your work tasks. How has that been going?

[02:23] Jasmine: Pretty well, actually. I’ve been blocking out focused work sessions in my calendar with specific goals. It keeps me from multitasking too much, which is a challenge with a toddler around.

[02:25] Riley: That’s excellent. How do you feel about your energy levels during these blocks? Do they match your expectations?

[02:28] Jasmine: Mostly, yes. I notice I do my best work in the mornings, so I’ve scheduled the most challenging tasks then. Afternoons are for lighter tasks or meetings. It’s helping me feel more in control.

[02:30] Riley: Perfect. Recognizing your natural energy rhythms is key. And how about integrating your family life into your schedule? Any new strategies there?

[02:33] Jasmine: I’ve started doing “family-focused” blocks in the evenings, where I put away devices and just focus on my baby and partner. It’s hard sometimes to resist checking emails, but I remind myself that quality time is more important.

[02:35] Riley: That’s a great shift. Building those dedicated family blocks creates boundaries that reinforce your priorities. How are you feeling emotionally about juggling everything?

[02:38] Jasmine: Honestly, it’s a lot, but I’m feeling more confident. Having these systems in place makes me less anxious, knowing I have a plan. Still, some days are hard, especially when deadlines overlap with family needs.

[02:40] Riley: That’s completely normal. Flexibility is part of the process. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Let’s talk about energy management—any specific strategies you’ve found helpful?

[02:43] Jasmine: I’ve been trying to incorporate short breaks, like 5-minute stretches or breathing exercises, especially after intensive work sessions. It helps me reset.

[02:45] Riley: Excellent. Micro-breaks can significantly boost focus and energy. Do you think adding a quick self-care activity, like a brief mindfulness session or a walk, could be integrated into your routine?

[02:48] Jasmine: That might work. I could do a quick mindfulness exercise before starting work and maybe a walk during lunch if I have the time.

[02:50] Riley: Fantastic ideas. Now, thinking ahead, what would you like to focus on in our next session? Any particular challenges or goals?

[02:53] Jasmine: I’d like to work on communicating my boundaries more assertively with my team, especially about deadlines and expectations. Sometimes I hesitate to push back, fearing it might affect my reputation.

[02:55] Riley: That’s a valuable skill. We can role-play some scenarios to help you feel more confident asserting your boundaries. Anything else?

[02:57] Jasmine: Maybe also exploring how to incorporate more self-care into my busy schedule without feeling guilty. I want to keep my energy up long-term.

[02:59] Riley: Great! That will be our focus next time. To sum up today, you’ve made excellent progress on boundary-setting, time blocking, and family integration. Your awareness of energy rhythms is improving, and you’re experimenting with micro-breaks.

[03:00] Jasmine: Thank you, Riley. I feel more motivated now. It’s encouraging to see that small changes can make a difference.

[03:03] Riley: Absolutely, Jasmine. Remember, small consistent steps lead to lasting change. Before we finish, let’s set some action items:  
- Continue with your “end-of-workday” ritual.  
- Keep using time blocks for your tasks, prioritizing challenging work in the mornings.  
- Incorporate a brief mindfulness exercise daily.  
- Prepare some assertive boundary scripts for next week’s role-play.

Does that sound good?

[03:07] Jasmine: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thanks again, Riley. Looking forward to next week!

[03:08] Riley: Me too! Have a great week, Jasmine. Remember, you’re building a strong foundation—keep celebrating those wins. See you next time!
