Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any wins or challenges you'd like to start with?

[02:03] Jasmine: Hey Riley! Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit stretched lately. The work deadlines are piling up, and trying to juggle that with baby’s schedule has been tough. I did manage to stick to my new morning routine, though, so that’s a small win.

[02:05] Riley: That’s fantastic to hear about the morning routine! Small wins add up. Can you tell me more about how sticking to that routine feels? Like, what’s working well?

[02:07] Jasmine: Well, I’ve been waking up 15 minutes earlier, doing a quick stretch and planning my day with the Notion template we set up. It’s helped me feel more in control before the chaos of the day begins.

[02:10] Riley: That’s a strong start—getting ahead of the day with planning. How are you finding the energy levels during your work hours, especially with the added responsibilities at home?

[02:12] Jasmine: Honestly, I’m pretty drained by the afternoon. I notice I lose focus faster, and I get moody. I’ve been trying to nap when the baby naps, but it’s hit or miss.

[02:15] Riley: Energy management is definitely a common challenge. Have you thought about scheduling intentional mini-breaks or energy resets during the day? Like a quick breathing exercise or a stretch?

[02:17] Jasmine: I’ve thought about it, but I often forget or feel guilty taking time away from work or baby duties. It’s like I don’t want to fall behind.

[02:20] Riley: That’s a very common feeling, Jasmine. Remember, taking small intentional breaks isn’t a sign of falling behind—it’s actually boosting your productivity and well-being. We can build a system into your work schedule that makes these breaks feel automatic and guilt-free. Would you like to explore that?

[02:23] Jasmine: Yeah, that sounds good. I think I need a more structured approach so I can feel justified taking those moments.

[02:25] Riley: Absolutely. How about we set up a time-blocked schedule that includes short energy resets? For example, every 90 minutes, a 5-minute stretch or breathing pause. I can help you craft it so it fits with your current work rhythm.

[02:28] Jasmine: I like that. I think if I see it on my calendar, I’ll be more likely to do it. And I can set reminders.

[02:30] Riley: Perfect. Now, regarding boundaries—how are things going with setting limits around your work hours, especially since remote work can blur those lines?

[02:33] Jasmine: It’s still a challenge. I tend to work late because I think I need to catch up or finish tasks, but then I feel guilty about neglecting family time.

[02:36] Riley: That’s a common pattern. How about we revisit your work boundaries by defining a clear 'shutdown' ritual? Perhaps a specific activity that signals the end of your workday—like shutting down your laptop, a quick review of tomorrow’s priorities, or a family walk?

[02:39] Jasmine: Yeah, I like the idea of a ritual. It would help me mentally switch off. I used to do a quick review, but I stopped when things got busy.

[02:42] Riley: Great, let’s rebuild that habit. And to support that, we can set a start and end time for your workday in your calendar and use AI reminders to reinforce it. How does that sound?

[02:45] Jasmine: That sounds doable. I think I need that structure to keep me accountable.

[02:47] Riley: Excellent. Now, looking at your overall priorities—how are you feeling about your progress toward maintaining work growth while balancing family?

[02:50] Jasmine: Honestly, I feel like I’m making progress, but it’s still a constant balancing act. I want to stay on top of my projects without sacrificing time with the baby or my own self-care.

[02:53] Riley: That’s a very balanced perspective. Remember, it’s about quality, not just quantity. We can look at your weekly schedule to ensure you have dedicated family time, work time, and self-care—using time blocking and priority mapping.

[02:55] Jasmine: Yeah, I think planning ahead with my Notion templates can help with that. I just need to stick to it more consistently.

[02:58] Riley: Consistency is key, and I’m here to support you with that. For next week, let’s focus on refining your daily boundaries and energy resets, and I’ll send you some prompts to help you reflect on how well they worked.

[03:00] Jasmine: Sounds good. Thanks, Riley. I already feel more grounded just talking about it.

[03:02] Riley: I’m glad to hear that! You’re doing great work, Jasmine. Before we wrap up, any last thoughts or questions?

[03:05] Jasmine: Just that I appreciate the structured approach. It makes me feel more in control, and I’m excited to try these new routines.

[03:07] Riley: Wonderful! I’ll send over the updated schedule template and some quick tip reminders. Looking forward to hearing how it goes next week.

[03:10] Jasmine: Thanks so much, Riley. See you next week!

[03:12] Riley: Take care, Jasmine! Have a productive week ahead.
