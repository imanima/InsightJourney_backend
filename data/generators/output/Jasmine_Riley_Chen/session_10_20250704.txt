Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Happy July 4th! Hope you’re having a relaxing holiday so far. How are you feeling today?

Jasmine: Hi Riley! Thanks, I am. It’s a bit busy with the celebrations, but I’m glad we could connect. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit stretched trying to juggle everything lately.

Riley: That’s understandable, especially with the holiday and everything on your plate. Let’s start by checking in—what’s been most on your mind since our last session?

Jasmine: Well, I’ve been trying to stick to the new time blocking system we set up, but I keep slipping into my old habits. I also feel like I’m not setting clear boundaries between work and family time, especially with the baby around.

Riley: Thanks for sharing that. It’s pretty common to encounter those hurdles when establishing new routines. I remember in our last session, we aimed to refine your time blocks and clarify boundaries. How has the habit tracking been going?

Jasmine: Mostly okay. I’ve been using the Notion template you gave me, but sometimes I forget to update it, especially when I get pulled into last-minute tasks or emergencies.

Riley: That’s a good observation. It’s all part of the learning curve. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. How about the boundary-setting? Any moments where you successfully communicated your needs?

Jasmine: Yes, actually. Yesterday, I told my team I’d be offline after 6 p.m., and I managed to stick to it. My partner also helped by watching the baby so I could have some uninterrupted work time earlier in the day. It felt really good.

Riley: That’s fantastic! Clear communication + support system = stronger boundaries. How did it feel to set that boundary? Any challenges?

Jasmine: It felt empowering, but also a little uncomfortable at first. I worry about missing out or letting my team down, even though I know I need that time for myself and my family.

Riley: That’s a common feeling. Remember, setting boundaries isn’t about letting anyone down; it’s about protecting your energy so you can show up fully for both work and family. Have you considered any specific scripts or phrases to make boundary-setting easier?

Jasmine: Not really. I usually just say I’m unavailable, but maybe I could prepare a few phrases in advance to make it smoother.

Riley: Great idea. For example, “I’m focusing on family after 6 p.m., but I’ll follow up first thing tomorrow.” Having those ready can reduce hesitation. Let’s add that to your habit tracker as a mini goal this week. How does that sound?

Jasmine: I like that. It feels manageable.

[02:10] Riley: Excellent. Now, regarding your energy management—how are you feeling physically and mentally during the day? Any patterns or dips?

Jasmine: I notice I get more tired in the early afternoons, especially after lunch. Sometimes I push through, but I end up feeling sluggish and less focused.

Riley: That’s insightful. Have you tried incorporating any quick energy boosts—like short movement breaks or hydration routines—around that time?

Jasmine: Not consistently. I usually just keep working because I have deadlines.

Riley: Let’s experiment with a 5-minute stretch or a quick walk after lunch. We can put that into your schedule as a recurring task. Small changes like that can really boost your focus and energy.

Jasmine: Yeah, I think I can do that. It’s just about remembering to pause.

Riley: Absolutely. Also, with your role as a front-end engineer, your cognitive load is high. Structuring your day with intentional breaks can prevent burnout. Speaking of which, how are you managing sleep and self-care?

Jasmine: Sleep is okay, but I sometimes sacrifice it to catch up on work or chores. I know I need more rest, especially with the baby, but it’s hard to prioritize.

Riley: Sleep is foundational. Can we set a goal to establish a consistent bedtime routine? Maybe a relaxing activity before bed, like reading or gentle stretching, to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down.

Jasmine: That sounds good. I think I’ll try to start that tonight.

[02:20] Riley: Perfect. Now, looking ahead, I’d like us to refine your weekly planning. Have you been using the weekly review system we set up?

Jasmine: Not as consistently as I’d like. Sometimes I forget to review what I accomplished or plan for the next week.

Riley: No worries—it’s a process. Let’s make it a fun ritual. Maybe Sunday evening, you can do a quick 10-minute review, update your Notion, and set 2-3 priority goals for the week. How does that sound?

Jasmine: That’s doable. I’ll try to make it a regular habit.

Riley: Great. Remember, the goal is to create a sustainable rhythm that works for you and your family. Now, reflecting on our progress over these past sessions, what’s one thing you feel proud of?

Jasmine: I’m proud that I’ve started setting clearer boundaries and communicating better with my team. It’s made a noticeable difference in my stress levels.

Riley: That’s wonderful progress. And what’s one area you’d like to focus on next?

Jasmine: I want to improve my energy management throughout the day and keep consistent with my routines.

Riley: Perfect. We’ll keep working on small, actionable steps for that. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions or concerns about implementing these strategies?

Jasmine: Not right now. I think I just need to keep practicing and be patient with myself.

Riley: That’s the spirit. Remember, every small win counts. For next week, your action items are: prepare your boundary scripts, try the short energy breaks after lunch, and do your Sunday weekly review. Does that sound good?

Jasmine: Yes, I’m excited to get started.

Riley: Excellent. I look forward to hearing how it goes. Enjoy the rest of your holiday, Jasmine!

Jasmine: Thanks, Riley. Have a great Fourth! Talk soon.

[02:25] Riley: Bye for now!
