Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Jasmine (Front-end Engineer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How's everything been since our last session? Any big wins or new challenges popping up?

[02:05] Jasmine: Hey Riley! Thanks. Things have been a bit hectic, honestly. I’ve been trying to stick to my new work boundaries, but with the deadlines last week, I felt like I was constantly toggling between work and family, sometimes feeling guilty about not being fully present for either.

[02:10] Riley: That sounds tough, but also very relatable—especially with those tight deadlines. Remember in our last session we talked about setting clearer boundaries? How has that been going for you?

[02:15] Jasmine: I tried to implement time blocking more strictly, especially around my core work hours. I even shared my schedule with my team so they know when I’m available. But then, sometimes urgent tasks come up, and I end up working late, which messes with my energy and family time.

[02:20] Riley: That’s a common challenge, and it’s great you’re already practicing transparency with your team—that’s a huge step! When those urgent tasks pop up, how do you usually handle them? Do you have a system for prioritizing those interruptions?

Jasmine: I try to assess if it’s truly urgent or can wait until tomorrow, but often I feel pressured to handle them immediately, especially if they’re from my manager. It’s like I don’t want to seem unresponsive.

[02:25] Riley: That’s understandable. Assertive communication can help here—setting expectations about your availability. Maybe a quick message like, “I’m focusing on deep work now but can get to this first thing tomorrow” could work? How does that idea sit with you?

Jasmine: I like that. It feels good to have a polite way to push back without feeling guilty. I think I need to practice that more.

[02:30] Riley: Absolutely, practice makes perfect. And speaking of energy, how have your energy levels been, especially balancing work and caring for your baby?

Jasmine: Honestly, it varies. Some days I wake up energized; other days, I feel drained by mid-morning, especially when sleep is interrupted. I’ve been trying to incorporate small self-care moments, but I struggle to find time.

[02:35] Riley: That’s a common issue, especially with new motherhood. Remember, even 5-minute self-care routines can help replenish your energy. Have you tried blocking specific times for quick resets—like stretching, deep breathing, or a brief walk?

Jasmine: Not systematically, no. I guess I just try to squeeze in whatever I can, but it’s inconsistent.

[02:40] Riley: Let’s gamify this a bit. How about we create a “Self-Care Power-Up” system? Each time you do a 5-minute reset, you earn a point, and once you hit 10 points, you reward yourself with something enjoyable—maybe a favorite snack or a quick podcast break. Would that motivate you?

Jasmine: (smiling) I love that idea! It makes it feel more fun and intentional.

[02:45] Riley: Great! Now, circling back to work boundaries, how’s your current system for managing your tasks? Are you using your AI Kanban board effectively?

Jasmine: I am, but I admit I sometimes get overwhelmed with all the moving parts—especially when new tasks come in and I don’t know where to slot them.

[02:50] Riley: That’s where priority mapping can come in handy. Let’s review your current task list. Are there tasks that are urgent but less important, or can some be deferred or delegated?

Jasmine: Yes, I think some of the routine code review tasks could be delegated to a junior team member. That would free up time for strategic planning and mentorship.

[02:55] Riley: Perfect! Delegation is a powerful tool. How about we set a goal this week: identify at least two tasks you can delegate, and practice communicating that clearly to your team?

Jasmine: Done. I’ll pick those tasks today.

[03:00] Riley: Excellent. As we look ahead, I want to check in on your habit of weekly reflection. Have you been consistently reviewing your progress and adjusting your routines?

Jasmine: Not as much as I’d like. I get caught up in daily firefighting.

[03:05] Riley: That’s understandable. How about integrating a 5-minute end-of-day reflection into your routine? Use your Notion template to jot down what worked, what didn’t, and what you’ll focus on tomorrow. It’s a small habit with big benefits.

Jasmine: That sounds manageable. I’ll give it a try.

[03:10] Riley: Great! To summarize today’s action items:  
1. Practice assertive communication with your team about urgent tasks.  
2. Set up your Self-Care Power-Up system.  
3. Identify two tasks for delegation.  
4. Incorporate daily reflection into your evening routine.

Does that cover everything? Any questions or tweaks?

Jasmine: No, I think that’s a solid plan. Thanks, Riley. I already feel a bit more in control just talking through this.

[03:15] Riley: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, progress is a series of small wins. I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Next week, we can follow up on how those delegation and boundary practices are working. Sound good?

Jasmine: Absolutely. Looking forward to it.

[03:20] Riley: Perfect. Have a great week, Jasmine! And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before our next session.

Jasmine: Will do. Thanks again, Riley!

[03:25] Riley: Take care!
