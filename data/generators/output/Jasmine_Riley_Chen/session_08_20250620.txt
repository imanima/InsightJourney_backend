[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How has your week been? Any wins or surprises since our last session?

[02:03] Jasmine: Hey Riley! Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I managed to implement some of the time blocking techniques we discussed, but I still feel like I’m struggling to keep boundaries with work, especially now that I’m home with the baby more often.

[02:07] Riley: That’s totally understandable. It’s a big transition, juggling work and family. Let’s start there—what’s been working well for you with the time blocking, and where do you feel it’s breaking down?

[02:10] Jasmine: Well, I’ve set dedicated blocks for deep work in the mornings, and I do try to stick to them. But sometimes, I find myself checking emails during those blocks or sneaking in small tasks, which makes me feel like I’m never fully present or productive.

[02:13] Riley: Ah, classic. It’s like your brain is whispering, “Just a quick peek,” and then suddenly, it’s a full email scan. (smiles) How about setting some concrete ‘tech-free’ boundaries during those blocks? Maybe turning off notifications or using a focus mode?

[02:15] Jasmine: That makes sense. I’ve been meaning to do that, but I keep forgetting. Maybe I need a visual cue or a reminder.

[02:18] Riley: Definitely. I can help you set up a simple Notion checklist or a visual cue—like a sticky note on your monitor—that reminds you to activate focus mode before each block. Also, let’s revisit your work boundaries: what do you think about communicating your schedule more assertively with your team?

[02:23] Jasmine: Yeah, I think I need to be clearer. Sometimes I hesitate to set boundaries because I don’t want to seem uncooperative, but then I end up overcommitting and feeling overwhelmed.

[02:26] Riley: That’s a common challenge. How about framing your boundaries as a way to be more effective? For example, “I’m focusing on deep work now, so I’ll respond to non-urgent messages after this block.” Would that feel comfortable?

[02:30] Jasmine: I like that. It sounds respectful but firm. I’ll try using that language.

[02:33] Riley: Perfect. Now, regarding energy management—how are you feeling physically and mentally during the day? Any patterns or triggers you’ve noticed?

[02:36] Jasmine: Honestly, I notice I get a big energy dip around 2 or 3 pm, which is also when I feel the most distracted. I think it’s partly fatigue, partly just a mental slump.

[02:39] Riley: That’s a common time for an energy dip. Have you experimented with quick self-care routines or micro-breaks during that window? Maybe a 5-minute stretch, a quick walk, or some hydration?

[02:42] Jasmine: Not consistently, no. I tend to just push through, but I know that’s not ideal.

[02:45] Riley: It’s a great insight. Small intentional breaks can reset your focus. Also, how’s your energy management with your sleep schedule? Are you getting enough rest with the baby?

[02:48] Jasmine: Sleep is still tricky. Some nights are better than others, but I often wake up multiple times. I’ve been trying to nap when I can, but it doesn’t always happen.

[02:52] Riley: Rest is crucial, especially when balancing so much. Maybe we can set a goal to optimize your nap times or rest periods, even if they’re short. Also, do you have any routines to wind down at night?

[02:55] Jasmine: Not really. I usually just crash on the couch after putting the baby to sleep, then try to get a little work done or catch up on reading.

[02:58] Riley: It sounds like establishing a calming bedtime routine might help you wind down better. Even 10 minutes of stretching or mindfulness before bed could improve your sleep quality.

[03:02] Jasmine: That’s worth trying. I’ll give it a shot.

[03:05] Riley: Great. Now, let’s circle back to your long-term goals—balancing work growth with family time. How are you feeling about your progress there?

[03:08] Jasmine: Honestly, I think I’m making some headway. I’ve started setting clearer boundaries and using time blocks, but I still worry about missing out on career opportunities or feeling guilty when I focus on family.

[03:11] Riley: Those feelings are normal. Remember, setting boundaries isn’t just about saying no; it’s about creating sustainable space for both your work and family. How about scheduling regular check-ins with yourself to reflect on your priorities and feelings?

[03:15] Jasmine: That’s a good idea. Maybe a weekly journal prompt or a quick review every Sunday.

[03:18] Riley: I love that. It reinforces your awareness and helps you adjust as needed. Also, have you shared your boundary goals with your team or manager?

[03:22] Jasmine: Not yet. I think I was worried about how they’d react, but I realize it’s better to be upfront.

[03:25] Riley: Absolutely. Clear communication builds trust. Would you like help crafting a message or talking points for that conversation?

[03:28] Jasmine: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to do it thoughtfully.

[03:30] Riley: Great. We’ll work on that before our next session. Now, to summarize, your action items are: set up focus mode cues, practice assertive boundary communication, introduce micro-breaks during energy dips, and develop a simple bedtime routine.

[03:35] Jasmine: Sounds good. I feel more confident about taking these steps.

[03:37] Riley: Awesome. Before we finish, any lingering questions or concerns?

[03:40] Jasmine: Not right now. I think I just need to start small and be patient with myself.

[03:43] Riley: Exactly. Progress is a journey, not a sprint. I’ll check in with you next week to see how these tweaks are going. Keep celebrating the wins!

[03:45] Jasmine: Thanks, Riley. I appreciate your support.

[03:47] Riley: My pleasure! Have a great week, Jasmine. Talk soon!

[03:50] End of session.
