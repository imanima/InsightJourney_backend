Session 20/24
Date: September 12, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM
Client: Jasmine (Front-end Engineer)
Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any wins or surprises this week?

[02:03] Jasmine: Hi Riley. Yeah, actually, I think I’ve made some progress. I managed to set clearer boundaries with my team—stuck to my after-hours cutoff more consistently. It felt good not to be working late every night.

[02:05] Riley: That’s fantastic! Boundary setting can be tricky, especially when workload ramps up. What do you think helped you stick to those cutoffs this week?

[02:08] Jasmine: I started using that time blocking system we designed, and I also put a visible “work ends at 6 PM” note on my monitor. It kind of became a visual cue for me.

[02:10] Riley: Love that! Visual cues are powerful—almost like game checkpoints. How did it feel to enforce those boundaries, emotionally?

[02:12] Jasmine: Honestly, a bit challenging at first—like I was worried about letting my team down or missing something urgent. But I reminded myself that boundaries protect my energy and my family time.

[02:15] Riley: Exactly. It’s about maintaining your capacity to perform well without burnout. Speaking of energy, how’s your energy level during the workday? Any shifts?

[02:17] Jasmine: Actually, yes. I’ve been trying to do more energy-intensive tasks earlier in the day, when I feel most alert, and save meetings or lighter tasks for the afternoon. It’s helped me feel less drained.

[02:20] Riley: Smart move—matching tasks to your energy peaks. Did you notice any impact on your productivity or stress levels?

[02:22] Jasmine: Definitely. I feel more focused, less scatterbrained. And I’m not as anxious about running out of energy before the workday ends.

[02:25] Riley: That’s great progress. And how about your family time? Have you been able to carve out quality moments with your baby after work?

[02:27] Jasmine: Yes, I’ve started a new routine—after I clock out, I put my phone away and spend focused time with her. It’s been really nice, and I feel more present.

[02:30] Riley: That’s wonderful. Creating those intentional boundaries around family time can be game-changing. How do you feel about your overall work-life balance now?

[02:32] Jasmine: It’s improving, but I still struggle sometimes with guilt, especially when I need to focus on work deadlines.

[02:35] Riley: Guilt is common, especially when juggling so many priorities. Remember, setting boundaries isn’t just about saying no—it’s about saying yes to your well-being and your family. How comfortable do you feel asserting those boundaries when deadlines press?

[02:38] Jasmine: I think I’m getting better, but I still hesitate sometimes, especially if I sense my manager expects me to go the extra mile.

[02:40] Riley: That’s a familiar challenge. How about we role-play a quick scenario—say, a manager asks you to stay late unexpectedly. Would you like to try it now?

[02:42] Jasmine: Sure, let’s do it.

[02:43] Riley: Okay, I’ll play the manager. “Jasmine, I need you to stay late tonight to finish this sprint. Can you do it?”

[02:45] Jasmine: (smiles slightly) “Thanks for the update. I understand the importance of finishing the sprint, but I’ve already scheduled my evening family time. I’ll prioritize this first thing tomorrow morning and ensure it’s done by the deadline.”

[02:48] Riley: Nice! That’s assertive but respectful. How did that feel?

[02:50] Jasmine: A bit nerve-wracking, but I think I managed to communicate my boundaries clearly.

[02:52] Riley: Excellent. Building this muscle of assertiveness is key. Now, looking ahead, what’s one area you’d like to focus on for next week?

[02:55] Jasmine: I want to refine my time blocking even more, maybe include specific self-care activities during the day to keep my energy steady.

[02:58] Riley: Great idea. Incorporating short self-care routines can boost your energy and resilience. We'll create a simple habit tracker for that next time. Before we wrap up, any last reflections?

[03:00] Jasmine: I feel encouraged. The small wins—like setting boundaries and managing energy—are really making a difference. It feels more manageable now.

[03:02] Riley: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is a series of small steps. For next week, keep tracking your boundaries and energy, and let’s review how the new routines work. Any questions before we finish?

[03:05] Jasmine: Not right now. Thanks, Riley. This session helped clarify my next moves.

[03:07] Riley: Awesome. I’ll send you a Notion template for your self-care habit tracker and a quick checklist for boundary assertiveness. Looking forward to hearing about your continued progress next week!

[03:10] Jasmine: Sounds good. Thanks again!

[03:12] Riley: Take care, Jasmine. Have a great week implementing these new routines!
