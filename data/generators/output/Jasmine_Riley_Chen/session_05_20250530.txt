Professional: Riley Chen (Executive Function & ADHD Coach)

[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Glad you could make it today. How’s everything been since our last session? Any wins or surprises?

[02:05] Jasmine: Hey Riley! Thanks, I’ve been good. Actually, I managed to set clearer boundaries at work last week. I blocked out specific hours for deep work and communicated that to my team. It felt pretty good, but I’m still adjusting to not checking emails after hours.

[02:10] Riley: That’s fantastic progress! Boundary setting can be tough at first, especially when we’re used to being constantly reachable. How did it feel to communicate those boundaries? Was there any resistance, internally or from others?

[02:15] Jasmine: Honestly, a bit nervous at first. I was worried about seeming uncollaborative. But I explained I need focused time to do quality work, and my team was understanding. I even got a couple of positive comments about my clarity.

[02:20] Riley: Nice! That’s a great example of assertive communication. It’s all about framing it around your needs and mutual respect. How do you feel now about maintaining those boundaries going forward?

Jasmine: I feel more confident, but I know I’ll need reminders. Sometimes I still catch myself slipping into checking Slack or emails after hours.

[02:25] Riley: That’s normal—habit change takes time. We can build in some accountability measures, like a habit tracker or visual cues. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Speaking of which, how’s the energy management with the baby? Any new insights there?

[02:30] Jasmine: That’s been a rollercoaster. Some days I feel super energized, especially when I get good sleep. But other days, I hit a wall in the afternoons, especially after back-to-back meetings.

[02:35] Riley: That’s quite common, especially with new motherhood and juggling work. Have you tried any specific techniques to recharge or manage those energy dips?

Jasmine: I’ve tried quick stretches or a short walk when I can. Also, I’ve been experimenting with scheduled power naps, but it’s tricky to find the right window.

[02:40] Riley: Those are smart strategies. Power naps can be game-changers if timed well. Maybe we can look into optimizing your energy peaks and valleys with some time blocking, aligning your most demanding tasks with your high-energy periods.

Jasmine: Yeah, I’d love that. Sometimes I push through tough tasks when I’m low on energy, and it just drags everything out.

[02:45] Riley: Exactly. Structuring your day around your natural rhythms can make a big difference. Do you have any current blocks dedicated to focused work or family time?

Jasmine: Not yet. My schedule is kind of a patchwork. I want to create dedicated blocks for work, but also for quality family time without work interruptions.

[02:50] Riley: That’s a great goal. We can develop a simple weekly plan, using your calendar to set those boundaries explicitly. Also, incorporating mini rituals for switching modes—like a quick walk or a specific song—can help signal to your brain that it’s family or work time.

Jasmine: I like that. I think it would help me feel more present, especially during family time.

[02:55] Riley: Perfect. And as a check-in, let’s revisit your Notion habit dashboard next session, and maybe add some visual cues for your boundaries. How does that sound?

Jasmine: Sounds good. I’ve been meaning to review it, but haven’t gotten around to it.

[03:00] Riley: Great. Before we wrap up today, what’s one small step you want to focus on before our next session?

Jasmine: I’ll set up specific time blocks for work and family this week, and practice asserting those boundaries with my team.

[03:05] Riley: Excellent plan. Remember, celebrate the small wins—each boundary you set is a step toward your bigger goals. I’ll send you some prompts for energy tracking and boundary reminders. Anything else you want to cover today?

Jasmine: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Riley. I’m feeling motivated to keep at it.

[03:10] Riley: I’m glad to hear that! Keep experimenting, and I’ll see you next week with some new tools to support your progress. Have a great week, Jasmine!

Jasmine: Thanks, you too! Bye!

[03:15] Riley: Bye!
