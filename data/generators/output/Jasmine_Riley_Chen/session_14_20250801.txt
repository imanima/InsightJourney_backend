[02:00] Riley: Hi Jasmine! Great to see you again. How’s everything been since our last session? Any wins or surprises this week?

[02:05] Jasmine: Hey Riley! Thanks. Yeah, I think I’ve made some progress. I’ve started setting clearer boundaries with my team about my work hours, which feels good. But honestly, I still find myself slipping into work mode outside of those hours sometimes.

[02:10] Riley: That’s a solid step—recognition is half the battle! It’s normal to slip now and then, especially when you’re juggling a lot. How did it feel to set those boundaries? Did you notice any particular triggers for slipping back?

[02:15] Jasmine: It was a bit uncomfortable at first, honestly. I worried about letting the team down if I wasn’t responsive. But I reminded myself of the importance of family time and my own energy levels. Still, I caught myself checking emails after dinner a couple of times.

[02:20] Riley: That’s very common, and it shows awareness—that’s key. Maybe we can work on creating some quick, visual cues or rituals that reinforce your boundaries. Like a “work-off” signal when you’re done for the day, or a physical token that reminds you to switch modes.

[02:25] Jasmine: That sounds helpful. I like the idea of a token. Maybe I can use my phone’s Do Not Disturb mode as a signal, but I worry I might forget sometimes.

[02:30] Riley: That’s where some gamified accountability could come in. Perhaps you earn points for successfully switching off work at the right time, and those points could unlock a small reward—like an episode of your favorite show or some quiet family time.

[02:35] Jasmine: I like that! Turning it into a game makes it less of a chore. I think I could get behind that. Also, I think I need to get better at scheduling my energy peaks. Some mornings I feel ready to code, but by afternoon, I’m wiped.

[02:40] Riley: Absolutely. Energy management is crucial. Have you tried time blocking around your natural energy rhythms? For example, scheduling deep work sessions during your high-energy periods and lighter tasks or breaks when you’re more tired.

[02:45] Jasmine: I’ve experimented a bit, but I haven’t been consistent. I tend to just work as tasks come up, which leads to burnout sometimes.

[02:50] Riley: Let’s revisit your weekly schedule. I suggest creating a structured time-blocking plan that aligns with your energy highs and lows. You could also set small, intentional breaks—like a 5-minute stretch or a quick walk—to reset.

[02:55] Jasmine: That makes sense. I think I also need to communicate better with my team about my availability, especially during those high-energy slots, so they don’t expect instant responses.

[03:00] Riley: Excellent point. Clear communication is a big part of boundary setting. Maybe you can draft a standard message or an auto-reply that indicates your working hours and preferred response times. That way, you’re proactive about managing expectations.

[03:05] Jasmine: I like that idea. I could even include a brief explanation that it helps me stay focused and deliver better work for everyone.

[03:10] Riley: Perfect. And remember, it’s about consistency and reinforcing those boundaries. Over time, it becomes the norm for your team—and for yourself. How do you feel about implementing these strategies this week?

[03:15] Jasmine: I feel motivated. I think I can start by setting up the visual cue, adjusting my schedule based on my energy, and drafting that message. It feels manageable.

[03:20] Riley: That’s a great plan. As a quick recap, your action steps are: 1) Create a visual “work-off” cue, 2) Adjust your schedule with time blocks aligned to your energy, and 3) Draft a clear message about your availability. Would you like to check in on your habit tracker next week to see how these are going?

[03:25] Jasmine: Yes, definitely. Tracking will help me stay accountable and see progress.

[03:30] Riley: Awesome. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling overall about your work-life balance and energy management?

[03:35] Jasmine: Honestly, I feel more in control than I was a few weeks ago. It’s still a work in progress, but I see the path forward now.

[03:40] Riley: That’s wonderful to hear. Progress isn’t always linear, but each step counts. Remember, your efforts are building new habits that support your well-being and career growth. Anything else on your mind today?

[03:45] Jasmine: Not right now. I think I just need to start implementing these changes and see how they go.

[03:50] Riley: Perfect. I’ll send you a quick summary of today’s action items, and we’ll review your progress in our next session. Keep being kind to yourself through the process.

[03:55] Jasmine: Thanks, Riley. I appreciate the support—and the game plan! Talk next week.

[04:00] Riley: Looking forward to it. Have a great week, Jasmine!
