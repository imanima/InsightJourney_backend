[01:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[01:02] Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired overall, but I think I’m managing better with some of the sleep routines we talked about last time.

[01:04] Dr. Torres: That’s good to hear. You mentioned last week that you were trying to stick to a consistent bedtime. How’s that been going?

[01:06] Priya: It’s been a bit of a challenge. Some nights I still find myself checking work emails late or scrolling through apps, even when I know I should be winding down.

[01:08] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, especially given your high-pressure role. Remember, we talked about stimulus control to help reinforce your sleep environment. Have you been able to avoid screens at least 30 minutes before bed?

[01:10] Priya: I’ve tried, but sometimes I get caught up in work or just can’t resist checking my phone. I do notice that when I do put it down earlier, I fall asleep faster.

[01:12] Dr. Torres: That’s a great observation. Even small changes can make a difference. Have you considered using the “phone away” alarm we discussed, to remind you to disconnect?

[01:14] Priya: I set one up, actually. It goes off at 9:30 PM, which helps remind me to put my phone aside. Still working on sticking to it consistently.

[01:16] Dr. Torres: That’s progress. How about your sleep hygiene overall? Are there other habits you’ve tried to improve your sleep quality?

[01:18] Priya: Well, I’ve been trying to keep my bedroom cool and dark, and I’ve started using a white noise machine. I think it helps, but I still have trouble falling asleep some nights.

[01:20] Dr. Torres: It’s good you’re experimenting with those environmental factors. Sometimes, combining them with relaxation techniques can give an extra boost. Have you been practicing any relaxation exercises before bed?

[01:22] Priya: Yes, I’ve been doing some deep breathing and mindfulness meditation, mostly the body scan. I think it helps calm my mind a little.

[01:24] Dr. Torres: That’s excellent. How effective have you found these practices in easing your racing thoughts?

[01:26] Priya: They do help, especially if I start the routine early enough. But sometimes my mind still jumps to work worries, especially if I get a late email.

[01:28] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. Remember, part of CBT is cognitive restructuring—challenging those unhelpful thoughts. Have you been able to identify specific worries that tend to keep you awake?

[01:30] Priya: Yes, mostly about deadlines or whether I’ve completed everything perfectly at work. I catch myself thinking, “I should be doing more,” even when I know I’ve done enough.

[01:32] Dr. Torres: That perfectionist tendency can definitely interfere with sleep. Let’s try to reframe those thoughts. For example, when you think “I should be working right now,” you might tell yourself, “I’ve done what I can today; rest is part of my productivity.”

[01:34] Priya: That makes sense. I like the idea of viewing rest as something that actually helps me perform better.

[01:36] Dr. Torres: Exactly. And over time, practicing this cognitive shift can reduce the stress associated with those thoughts. How does that sound?

[01:38] Priya: It sounds helpful. I think I need to remind myself of that when I start feeling anxious about work at night.

[01:40] Dr. Torres: Great. Now, considering your work schedule, have you thought about setting boundaries, like a hard cutoff time for work emails and messages?

[01:42] Priya: Yes, I’ve tried to set a 7 PM cutoff, but I sometimes get caught up, especially when urgent things come up. I think I need to be stricter with myself.

[01:44] Dr. Torres: It’s a good goal. Maybe you can communicate those boundaries to your team or supervisor, so they’re aware of your availability. Also, how do you feel about scheduling a brief wind-down ritual, like a 10-minute walk or reading, before bed?

[01:46] Priya: I could do that. I’ve been meaning to start reading more anyway. Maybe that will help me disconnect from screens and work thoughts.

[01:48] Dr. Torres: That sounds promising. Small, consistent changes like that can build a stronger sleep routine. How are you feeling about your progress so far?

[01:50] Priya: Honestly, I think I’ve made some good steps, especially with the environmental tweaks and trying to be mindful about my thoughts. Sleep is still not perfect, but I feel more in control.

[01:52] Dr. Torres: That’s fantastic progress. Remember, improvements in sleep often happen gradually. Next time, we can explore some targeted behavioral experiments to test these new habits further.

[01:54] Priya: I’d like that. Thanks, Dr. Torres. It feels good to have some concrete strategies to work on.

[01:56] Dr. Torres: I’m glad. Before we wrap up, let’s set some specific action items: continue with your phone restriction, practice your relaxation routine each night, and try to establish a consistent bedtime and wind-down ritual. Does that sound manageable?

[01:58] Priya: Yes, I can do that. I’ll check in with myself about how it’s going next week.

[02:00] Dr. Torres: Perfect. I look forward to hearing about your progress. See you next week, Priya.

[02:02] Priya: Thanks so much, Dr. Torres. Have a good rest of your day.

[02:03] Dr. Torres: You too. Take care.
