01:00  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. Some nights I sleep okay, but other nights I still struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep for more than a few hours.  

01:05  
Dr. Torres: Thanks for sharing that. Last time, we discussed your sleep patterns and tried some sleep hygiene techniques. Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns that seem to influence your sleep quality?  
Priya: Well, I think I tend to work late into the night, especially when I have deadlines or feel behind on my projects. Also, I catch myself checking work emails right before bed sometimes, even though I know I shouldn’t.  

01:10  
Dr. Torres: That’s an important insight. It sounds like work stress and your bedtime routines might be impacting your sleep. How have you been managing your workload and boundaries around work lately?  
Priya: I’ve tried to set stricter boundaries, like turning off notifications after 8 pm, but honestly, I still get anxious about missing something important, so I sometimes sneak a quick check. It’s like I can’t fully disconnect.  

01:15  
Dr. Torres: That’s very common among high-achievers. Your perfectionist tendencies can make it hard to fully unwind. From what you’ve described, it seems like the anxiety about work can feed into sleep difficulties. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or worries that come up in those moments?  
Priya: Yes, I keep thinking, “What if I miss an urgent email? What if I overlook something critical?” It feels like my mind is racing.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s a typical cognitive pattern—catastrophizing about missing out or making mistakes. We’ve seen that this kind of thinking can increase anxiety and interfere with sleep. Would you be open to trying some cognitive restructuring to challenge these thoughts?  
Priya: Yeah, I think that could help. Sometimes I know the thoughts aren’t entirely rational, but I can’t seem to stop them.  

01:25  
Dr. Torres: Absolutely. One approach is to identify the evidence for and against these worries and then develop more balanced thoughts. For example, you might ask yourself, “Has missing an email ever truly caused a major problem for me?” What’s your take on that?  
Priya: Hmm, actually, I guess most of the urgent emails I’ve missed weren’t as critical as I thought. Sometimes I overestimate the impact.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: Exactly. Recognizing that can help reduce the anxiety. Now, let’s talk about your bedtime routine. When you do go to sleep, what do you usually do right before?  
Priya: I usually sit on my couch, scroll through social media, or binge-watch some shows. Sometimes I check my work email one last time.  

01:35  
Dr. Torres: That’s quite common, but it can be stimulating and interfere with sleep onset. Have you considered establishing a winding-down routine that’s calming?  
Priya: I’ve thought about it, but I find it hard to stick to because I feel like I don’t have enough time, especially after a long day.  

01:40  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. We can work on a brief, effective routine. For example, we could incorporate some relaxation exercises or mindfulness practices that take just 10-15 minutes. Would you be interested in trying that?  
Priya: Yes, I think that could work. I’d like to try something that helps me relax without taking up too much time.  

01:45  
Dr. Torres: Great. We can start with a simple breathing exercise and some progressive muscle relaxation. Also, I’d like us to revisit sleep restriction therapy—limiting your time in bed to match your actual sleep time to improve sleep efficiency. How does that sound?  
Priya: It sounds a bit daunting, but I understand the goal is to get better sleep overall. I’m willing to give it a try.  

01:50  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. We’ll tailor it carefully to avoid frustration. Before we end today, I want to check in on your mood and overall stress levels. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being very high, how would you rate your stress this week?  
Priya: I’d say around a 6 or 7. Work has been busy, and I’m feeling a little overwhelmed at times.  

01:55  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. It’s important to recognize these fluctuations. Incorporating some mindfulness and relaxation techniques can help manage those moments. For next week, I’d like you to practice the cognitive restructuring exercises and the relaxation routine we discussed. Also, keep tracking your sleep and note any patterns or changes. Does that sound manageable?  
Priya: Yes, I can do that. I’ll try to be consistent with the new routines.  

02:00  
Dr. Torres: Perfect. We’ll review how these strategies are working and make adjustments as needed. Remember, progress takes time, and small changes can lead to significant improvements. Do you have any questions or anything else you’d like to share before we wrap up?  
Priya: Not right now. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel hopeful about trying these new techniques.  

02:05  
Dr. Torres: I’m glad to hear that. I appreciate your openness and commitment. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll continue working on these goals. Have a good rest of your day, Priya.  
Priya: Thank you, you too.
