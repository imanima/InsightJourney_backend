01:00  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some nights are better, but I still struggle with falling asleep. Work has been really demanding lately, so I feel pretty drained most days.  

01:05  
Dr. Harper: That sounds exhausting. It’s good you’re noticing some nights are better—that’s progress. Can you tell me more about the nights when sleep is more difficult? What’s going on then?  
Priya: Well, I usually lie in bed, and my mind just starts racing about work deadlines, emails I didn’t respond to, or even personal stuff I need to handle. It’s like my brain switches to autopilot, and I can’t shut it off.  

01:10  
Dr. Harper: That’s a common challenge, especially for high-achievers like you. We’ve talked before about your sleep routine and stress levels. How have you been managing your work boundaries lately?  
Priya: Honestly, I’ve been pretty bad at disconnecting. I check my phone right before bed, and sometimes even during the night if I wake up. I know it’s not ideal, but I feel like I need to stay on top of everything.  

01:15  
Dr. Harper: That’s understandable, but as we discussed, the light from screens and constant notifications can interfere with melatonin production and make it harder to fall asleep. Have you tried any of the sleep hygiene tips we covered, like turning off devices an hour before bed?  
Priya: I’ve tried, but I admit I often forget or just can’t resist checking my email. I notice that when I do that, it takes longer to fall asleep, and I wake up feeling less rested.  

01:20  
Dr. Harper: That’s valuable insight. It shows your awareness, which is a great first step. Let’s revisit your bedtime routine—what does it currently look like?  
Priya: Usually, I finish work around 9:00 pm, then I try to wind down by doing some reading or listening to music. But I often end up browsing social media or watching videos on my phone until I’m too tired to stay awake.  

01:25  
Dr. Harper: So, the issue is that your wind-down activities aren’t fully relaxing or are involving screens. We can work on some specific strategies—like establishing a strict cutoff time, maybe 8:30 pm, where you turn off all screens and switch to a calming activity like mindfulness or journaling. How does that sound?  
Priya: That sounds doable. I think I’d like to try that. I do notice that when I meditate or do breathing exercises, I feel more relaxed and fall asleep faster.  

01:30  
Dr. Harper: Excellent. Incorporating mindfulness could strengthen your sleep onset. We can also explore sleep restriction therapy—limiting time in bed to match your actual sleep time to enhance sleep efficiency. Do you recall the sleep diary we discussed last time?  
Priya: Yes, I’ve been keeping track. On good nights, I fall asleep within 20 minutes, but on bad nights, it’s sometimes over an hour. Overall, my sleep window averages about 6 hours.  

01:35  
Dr. Harper: That’s helpful data. Based on that, we can set a fixed wake-up time and gradually adjust your bedtime to improve sleep quality. For instance, if you’re waking up at 7:00 am, we could aim to go to bed around 11:00 pm initially, then shift earlier as your sleep improves.  
Priya: Okay, that makes sense. I just worry about feeling more tired at first, since I need my energy for work.  

01:40  
Dr. Harper: That’s a common concern. The idea is to consolidate your sleep and make it more efficient, so eventually you’ll feel more rested with less time in bed. Plus, managing stress during the day will also help. How has your stress management routine been? Are you still practicing meditation daily?  
Priya: I’ve been trying, but some days I skip it because I feel so overwhelmed. When I do meditate, I notice it helps me calm down, but I have trouble making it a consistent habit.  

01:45  
Dr. Harper: Consistency can be tough, especially with busy schedules. Perhaps we can set a specific time in the evening—say, right after work—to do a 10-minute mindfulness exercise. That way, it becomes part of your routine. Would that work for you?  
Priya: Yeah, I think I can do that. It might help me disconnect from work stress before bed.  

01:50  
Dr. Harper: Great. And remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Over time, these small changes can make a significant difference. Before we wrap up, let’s review your action items:  
- Set a strict screen cutoff time at 8:30 pm.  
- Practice a calming activity, like journaling or mindfulness, immediately after that.  
- Keep your sleep diary updated, noting how these changes affect your sleep.  
- Incorporate a 10-minute mindfulness session right after work.  

Priya: Sounds good. I’ll give it a try this week.  

01:55  
Dr. Harper: Excellent. And I’ll check in with you next session about how these adjustments are working. Remember, it’s a process, and I’m here to support you. Do you have any questions or anything else you want to discuss before we finish?  
Priya: Not right now, but I appreciate the guidance. I’m hopeful these small steps will help.  

02:00  
Dr. Harper: Me too, Priya. You’re making meaningful progress. Looking forward to hearing how it goes. Have a good rest of your day!  
Priya: Thanks, Dr. Torres. You too.
