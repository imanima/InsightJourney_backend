[01:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? (smiles gently)

[01:02] Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. My sleep's still pretty inconsistent, and I’ve been feeling a lot of work stress, especially with some big deadlines approaching.

[01:05] Dr. Harper: That sounds challenging. You mentioned last time that sleep has been a persistent issue. Have you noticed any patterns or specific triggers lately?

[01:07] Priya: Well, I tend to stay up later trying to finish work projects, even if I’m exhausted. And then I wake up in the middle of the night worrying about tomorrow’s tasks. My sleep tracker shows a lot of interrupted sleep, sometimes only 4-5 hours.

[01:10] Dr. Harper: That’s helpful to know. It sounds like work stress is spilling into your bedtime routine and disrupting your sleep cycle. Have you been able to implement any of the sleep hygiene tips we discussed previously?

[01:12] Priya: I’ve tried some, like avoiding screens an hour before bed, but I still find myself scrolling or checking emails late. I think I’m just so used to being connected that it’s hard to disconnect.

[01:15] Dr. Harper: That’s a common challenge, especially for high-achievers like you. We can explore some strategies to strengthen your bedtime routine, perhaps some stimulus control techniques to associate your bed with sleep only. Would you be open to trying a more structured approach this week?

[01:17] Priya: Yes, I think that would help. I really want to improve my sleep—my energy levels are so low during the day.

[01:20] Dr. Harper: Great. Let’s also touch on your work stress. You’ve mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times. How have you been managing that lately?

[01:22] Priya: Honestly, not very well. I tend to just push through, but I notice it’s making me more anxious, especially during the evenings. I keep replaying what I didn’t finish or what I need to do tomorrow.

[01:25] Dr. Harper: That’s a common perfectionist pattern—ruminating about what’s incomplete. We can work on some cognitive restructuring to challenge those thoughts. For example, asking yourself, “Is this urgent right now?” or “What’s a reasonable expectation for today’s workload?” Would you like to practice that?

[01:27] Priya: Yeah, I’d like that. Sometimes I feel like I need to be perfect to succeed, but I know that’s not always realistic.

[01:30] Dr. Harper: Exactly. Recognizing those perfectionist tendencies is a key step. We can also incorporate some mindfulness exercises to help you observe these thoughts without getting caught up in them. Do you have a meditation app you use?

[01:32] Priya: I do, actually. I’ve been using Calm, but I haven’t been consistent.

[01:35] Dr. Harper: Let’s set a goal to practice a brief mindfulness exercise daily—say, 5 minutes in the evening. Even a simple body scan or mindful breathing can help reduce ruminative thoughts and prepare your mind for sleep.

[01:37] Priya: That sounds doable. I think I just need to create a routine around it.

[01:40] Dr. Harper: Perfect. How about we also develop a specific bedtime routine this week? For example, dimming the lights an hour before bed, turning off screens, doing a relaxation exercise, and then reading something calming—nothing work-related. How does that sound?

[01:42] Priya: I like that. I think having a set routine will help signal to my brain that it’s time to wind down.

[01:45] Dr. Harper: Great. Let’s set some SMART goals for this week: First, practice the mindfulness exercise every night for 5 minutes. Second, implement your new bedtime routine consistently. And third, use cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge work-related anxious thoughts when they arise, especially in the evenings.

[01:47] Priya: That makes sense. I’ll try to stick to it.

[01:50] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Before we finish today, I want to acknowledge that progress takes time, and being patient with yourself is key. We’ll review how these strategies work for you next week. Do you feel comfortable with these action items?

[01:52] Priya: Yes, I do. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I already feel a bit more hopeful about managing my sleep and stress.

[01:55] Dr. Harper: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, small consistent steps make a big difference. I look forward to hearing about how this week goes. Have a good rest of your day, Priya.

[01:57] Priya: Thanks, you too. See you next week.

[01:58] Dr. Harper: Take care.
