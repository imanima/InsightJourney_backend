Client: Priya (VC Analyst)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

01:00  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. My sleep has improved somewhat, but I still wake up during the night more often than I’d like. And work stress is still pretty high.  

01:10  
Dr. Harper Torres: Thanks for sharing that. It’s good to hear there’s some progress with your sleep, but I understand the challenges remain. When you wake up at night, what do you notice immediately? Are you feeling anxious, or is it more about frustration?  
Priya: Mostly frustration, I think. I start thinking about work deadlines or some email I didn't respond to. It’s like my mind just switches into overdrive.  

01:15  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common pattern, especially among high-achievers like you. Remember in our last session, we talked about the importance of a calming bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down? Have you been trying any new relaxation techniques before bed?  
Priya: Yeah, I’ve been doing some meditation using an app, but honestly, I find it hard to stay focused and actually relax. Sometimes my thoughts just keep swirling.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Mindfulness can take time to develop. Have you noticed any difference in how you feel during the day, like your energy levels or stress?  
Priya: Slightly better in the mornings, but by late afternoon, I still feel pretty drained. My concentration has improved a bit, but I catch myself obsessing over tiny details at work.  

01:25  
Dr. Torres: It sounds like your perfectionism is still active, which can contribute to both stress and sleep difficulties. We’ve discussed cognitive restructuring before—challenging those all-or-nothing thoughts. Have you been able to identify any specific thoughts that pop up at night or during the day that escalate your anxiety?  
Priya: Yeah, especially about work. Like, if I think, “I should have finished that report by now,” I start feeling guilty and anxious. It’s like I’m never doing enough.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: That’s a very common perfectionist pattern. Remember, the goal is to recognize these thoughts and gently challenge them—ask yourself, “Is this really true? Is it helpful?” Sometimes, shifting from “I must do this perfectly” to “I’ll do my best, and that’s enough” can make a difference. Have you tried that?  
Priya: I’ve thought about it, but in the moment, it’s hard to break that cycle. It feels so real.  

01:35  
Dr. Torres: Absolutely, it’s a habit that takes practice. We can incorporate some cognitive restructuring exercises into your daily routine. Also, I recall you mentioning your sleep tracking apps—have you been tracking your sleep regularly?  
Priya: Yes, I’ve been using the app every night. It shows I wake up around 2-3 times, and my sleep efficiency is about 75%. Not perfect, but better than a couple of months ago.  

01:40  
Dr. Torres: That’s a good sign of progress. Sleep efficiency around 80% is typically considered healthy, so you’re close. We can look into some sleep restriction strategies to help consolidate your sleep further. Would you be open to trying a slightly more structured sleep schedule for a week or so?  
Priya: Yeah, I’m willing to try. I think I’ve been too flexible, which sometimes leads to irregular sleep.  

01:45  
Dr. Torres: Great. We’ll set a consistent bedtime and wake time, aiming for about 7-8 hours of sleep. Also, I want to revisit stimulus control—only using your bed for sleep and intimacy, avoiding work or screens in bed. How does that sound?  
Priya: That makes sense. I’ve noticed I sometimes scroll through emails in bed, which probably doesn’t help.  

01:50  
Dr. Torres: Exactly. Reassociating your bed with sleep is key. Let’s also discuss your work boundaries. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed—what’s your current approach to unwinding after work?  
Priya: Honestly, I tend to keep working late into the evening, even after I get home. I think I have this belief that I need to prove myself constantly.  

01:55  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common mindset among high-achievers. It’s important to set clear boundaries so your brain can shift gears. Perhaps implementing a ‘shutdown’ ritual—like turning off your work notifications and doing a relaxing activity—could help. Have you tried anything like that?  
Priya: Not systematically, no. I usually just keep checking my email and then get frustrated when I don’t get to everything.  

02:00  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Let’s work on creating a structured evening routine that signals to your brain it’s time to relax. For example, setting a specific time to stop work, followed by a brief mindfulness exercise or light stretching. How does that sound?  
Priya: I like the idea. I think I need more structure to help me disconnect.  

02:05  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. We’ll develop a tailored plan for your evening routine next week, and I’ll send some guided exercises. For now, I want you to experiment with a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens in bed, and practice the shutdown ritual. Also, keep using your sleep tracker to monitor progress.  

02:10  
Priya: Will do. I’m hopeful that these small changes can make a difference. It’s encouraging to see some progress, even if it’s gradual.  

02:15  
Dr. Torres: Absolutely, Priya. Change takes time, and even small improvements are steps forward. Remember, it’s about building sustainable habits. Before our next session, try implementing these routines, and we’ll review your progress. Any questions or concerns before we wrap up?  
Priya: No, I think that covers everything. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

02:20  
Dr. Torres: You’re welcome. I’m proud of your effort. Let’s check in on these strategies next week. Have a good rest of your day, Priya.  
Priya: Thanks, you too. Bye.
