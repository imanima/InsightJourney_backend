[01:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, good to see you again. How have you been since we last spoke?

[01:02] Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been trying to stick to the sleep routine we discussed, but some nights are better than others. Work has been pretty stressful lately, too.

[01:05] Dr. Torres: That sounds familiar. Last time, you mentioned difficulty unwinding after work and some persistent sleep issues. How have you been managing your work-related stress?

[01:08] Priya: I’ve been trying to set boundaries—like not checking emails after 6 pm—but I still find myself ruminating about deals or deadlines, especially at night. It’s hard to turn off my brain sometimes.

[01:10] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge among high achievers. Ruminating can really interfere with sleep. Did you notice any specific triggers or thoughts that come up when you’re trying to relax?

[01:12] Priya: Yeah, I often think, “Did I miss something?” or “What if I don’t catch up tomorrow?” It’s like my mind just won’t shut down.

[01:15] Dr. Torres: It sounds like these are perfectionist thoughts—like a fear of missing out or not performing well. Have you noticed any patterns in your sleep logs or mood trackers related to those thoughts?

[01:17] Priya: I did notice that on nights when I stay up worrying, I tend to wake up feeling exhausted, even if I get the same amount of sleep time.

[01:20] Dr. Torres: That’s a good observation. Worry and rumination can cause what we call “hyperarousal,” making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Let’s explore some techniques to help manage those thoughts better—like cognitive restructuring. Would you like to try that today?

[01:23] Priya: Yes, I think that could help. Sometimes, I just can’t shake the feeling that I should be doing more.

[01:25] Dr. Torres: Great. We’ll also review your sleep hygiene and introduce some relaxation strategies. But first, how’s your sleep tracking been? Any changes since last week?

[01:28] Priya: I’ve been consistent with the app. I noticed that on nights I go to bed later, I wake up more often and feel more groggy, even if I technically get 7 hours.

[01:30] Dr. Torres: That aligns with what we know—sleep timing can affect sleep quality. Did you try adjusting your bedtime earlier last week?

[01:32] Priya: I did, but I found it hard to fall asleep earlier, especially when I was still working or thinking about stuff.

[01:35] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Sometimes, establishing a calming pre-sleep routine can help signal to your body that it’s time to unwind. Did you implement any part of your bedtime routine?

[01:38] Priya: I tried dimming the lights and doing some deep breathing exercises, but I still found my mind racing.

[01:40] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. We can work on enhancing those relaxation techniques—perhaps with mindfulness meditation or progressive muscle relaxation. Would you like me to guide you through a brief relaxation now?

[01:43] Priya: Yes, please. That might help.

[01:45] Dr. Torres: Alright. Let’s begin by finding a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so. Take a deep breath in through your nose… and exhale slowly through your mouth. (pauses) Focus on the sensation of your breath—notice the coolness as you inhale and the warmth as you exhale. If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath.

[01:50] Priya: (takes deep breath) Okay, I’m feeling a little more relaxed.

[01:52] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Practicing this for a few minutes before bed can help calm your nervous system. Now, regarding your thoughts about missing out or not doing enough—how about trying to challenge those with some cognitive restructuring?

[01:55] Priya: Sure. I guess I could try to reframe those thoughts.

[01:57] Dr. Torres: For example, if you think, “I should be working right now,” you might reframe it as, “It’s okay to rest now; I’ll be more productive if I’m well-rested.” Can you think of a specific thought you’ve had recently that we can work on?

[02:00] Priya: Yeah, last night I kept thinking, “I need to finish this report tomorrow, or I’ll fail.”

[02:03] Dr. Torres: That’s a common fear. Let’s reframe it: “I’ve done my best today, and I will prioritize my tasks tomorrow. Missing some sleep tonight won’t mean I fail.” How does that sound?

[02:05] Priya: It’s reassuring, but I still feel anxious about the deadline.

[02:07] Dr. Torres: That’s normal. Anxiety can persist even with cognitive shifts. We’ll continue practicing these reframes, and I’ll give you some worksheets to help reinforce them. Moving forward, let’s also revisit your sleep hygiene. Are you still avoiding caffeine after 2 pm and keeping screens out of the bedroom?

[02:10] Priya: Yes, I’ve been sticking to that, but I do sometimes scroll on my phone in bed, especially when I can’t sleep.

[02:12] Dr. Torres: That’s a common habit. The blue light from screens can interfere with melatonin production. I recommend placing your phone outside the bedroom or using an app that reduces blue light during your pre-sleep routine.

[02:15] Priya: I’ll try that. I really want to improve my sleep.

[02:17] Dr. Torres: That’s a great goal. To summarize today, we’ll continue working on cognitive restructuring of racing thoughts, enhance your relaxation practices, and refine your sleep hygiene habits. How does that sound?

[02:20] Priya: That sounds good. I feel like I’m making some progress, even if it’s slow.

[02:22] Dr. Torres: Progress often takes time, especially with sleep and stress. Remember to be patient with yourself. For next week, try practicing the relaxation technique before bed and noting any changes in your sleep log. Also, keep challenging those perfectionist thoughts as they arise. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?

[02:25] Priya: Not right now. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate the support.

[02:27] Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Priya. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Take care until then.
