Client: Priya (VC Analyst)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

01:00  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi Dr. Torres. Um, honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some nights are better than others, but I still struggle with falling asleep, and my stress levels at work are pretty high.  

01:10  
Dr. Harper: That sounds challenging. Let’s start by checking in on your sleep. Have you noticed any patterns or changes in your sleep quality lately?  
Priya: Well, I’ve been sticking to the sleep schedule we talked about—trying to go to bed at the same time each night and limiting screen time before bed. But I still wake up multiple times during the night, and I often feel exhausted in the mornings.  

01:20  
Dr. Harper: Thanks for sharing that. It’s good you’re maintaining the routine; sometimes, sleep issues take a bit longer to improve. Have you noticed anything that might be triggering these awakenings? For example, work stress, thoughts about deadlines, or anything else?  
Priya (sighs): Yeah, definitely. I tend to ruminate about work even when I’m in bed. I keep thinking about projects I need to finish or emails I haven’t responded to. It’s like my mind won’t shut off.  

01:30  
Dr. Harper: That’s a common experience, especially for high-achievers like you. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed, such as mindfulness or breathing exercises?  
Priya: I’ve tried some breathing apps, but honestly, I find it hard to focus. My mind just keeps jumping back to work stuff.  

01:40  
Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. Sometimes, cognitive restructuring can help address those persistent thoughts. For example, reminding yourself that you’ve done your best today and tomorrow is a new opportunity. Would you like to practice a quick thought-challenging exercise now?  
Priya: Sure, I’m open to it.  

01:45  
Dr. Harper: Great. Think about a specific work-related thought that’s been bothering you tonight. For instance, “I need to finish this report tonight or I’ll fall behind.” Now, let’s challenge that thought. What’s the evidence for and against it?  
Priya: Well, I did finish most of the report today, and I know I can finish the rest tomorrow. But I worry that if I don’t do it tonight, I’ll get behind and it’ll affect my reputation.  

01:55  
Dr. Harper: That’s a common worry among perfectionists. It’s helpful to consider the actual consequences of not completing it tonight—will missing a deadline once seriously impact your reputation? Or is it more about avoiding the feeling of falling behind?  
Priya: I guess it’s mostly the fear of being seen as unreliable or not competent. But logically, I know missing a deadline once isn’t the end of the world.  

02:05  
Dr. Harper: Exactly. Recognizing that helps reduce the emotional charge of the thought. Now, let’s shift to your sleep habits. You mentioned waking up during the night—have you tried stimulus control, like getting out of bed if you’re awake for more than 20 minutes?  
Priya: Not consistently. I usually just lie there and try to will myself to fall asleep, which makes it worse.  

02:15  
Dr. Harper: That’s common. The idea is to associate your bed with sleep only, so if you’re awake, you get up and do something relaxing outside the bedroom until you feel sleepy again. Would you be comfortable trying that this week?  
Priya: Yeah, I think I can do that. It feels a bit uncomfortable at first, but I see how it might help.  

02:25  
Dr. Harper: Great. Also, let’s revisit your bedtime routine. Have you incorporated any calming activities, like reading or gentle stretches?  
Priya: I’ve been trying to read a physical book, but I often get caught up in work emails on my phone, even late at night.  

02:35  
Dr. Harper: That’s a common challenge. Remember, the goal is to create a buffer zone—at least 30 minutes before bed—without screens or work-related stimuli. Maybe setting a phone curfew could help?  
Priya: I think I can do that. I’ll try to leave my phone outside the bedroom and switch to a physical book.  

02:45  
Dr. Harper: Excellent. How are you feeling about these strategies overall? Do they seem manageable?  
Priya: They do. I appreciate having concrete steps. It’s just hard to break old habits, but I see the importance.  

02:55  
Dr. Harper: That’s a good insight. Change takes time, and progress is often gradual. Over the next week, focus on implementing the stimulus control and bedtime routine adjustments, and monitor how your sleep feels. We’ll review your sleep tracker data next session.  

03:05  
Priya: Sounds good. I’ll keep track and let you know how it goes. Also, I’ve been trying to incorporate mindfulness into my day, but I still find my mind racing during work hours sometimes.  
Dr. Harper: That’s normal. Mindfulness can be practiced in small moments—like a quick breathing exercise at your desk or a brief body scan. Would you like to try a short mindfulness exercise now?  
Priya: Yes, I’d like that.  

03:10  
Dr. Harper: Alright. Let’s do a 2-minute body scan. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and focus on your breath as you slowly move your attention through your body—from your toes up to your head. Notice any tension without trying to change it.  
(Priya closes her eyes and follows the exercise)  
03:20  
Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?  
Priya: It was calming. I can see how doing this during the day might help me stay grounded.  

03:30  
Dr. Harper: That’s wonderful. Incorporating brief mindfulness practices can help reduce overall stress and improve your ability to unwind at night. Before we finish, let’s set some specific goals for the week.  
Priya: I’ll focus on:  
- Leaving my phone outside the bedroom after 10 PM  
- Doing a body scan or breathing exercise before bed  
- Challenging work-related thoughts that come up at night  

03:40  
Dr. Harper: Those are excellent steps. Keep tracking your sleep and stress levels, and we’ll review your progress next week. Do you have any questions or concerns before we wrap up?  
Priya: No, I think I’m set. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel more hopeful about making some real changes.  

03:50  
Dr. Harper: I’m glad to hear that, Priya. Remember, progress is a process. I look forward to hearing how these strategies work for you. Have a good week ahead.  
Priya: Thanks, you too. Bye!
