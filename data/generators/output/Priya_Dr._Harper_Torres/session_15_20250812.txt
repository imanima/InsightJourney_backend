**Therapy Session Transcript**

**[01:00]**  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. Some nights are better, but I still struggle with falling asleep most of the time.  

Dr. Torres: Thanks for sharing that. I remember you mentioned last time that your sleep tracking showed some improvements but still some persistent issues. Can you tell me more about your sleep over the past week?  

Priya: Sure. I’ve been sticking to the new bedtime routine we discussed—no screens an hour before bed, some meditation, that kind of stuff. But I still find myself lying awake for an hour or more, especially after stressful days at work.  

Dr. Torres: That sounds frustrating, especially given how committed you've been to those changes. You mentioned stress—how has your work-related anxiety been lately?  

Priya: It’s been high. We had a couple of big pitches this week, and I kept replaying some of my presentations in my head. It’s like I can’t switch off my brain at night.  

Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, given your perfectionist tendencies and high standards. It’s good you’re aware of that. Have you noticed any pattern in the nights when sleep is particularly difficult?  

Priya: Yeah, on days when I feel like I didn’t perform well or missed a detail, I tend to stay awake longer. It’s like my brain won’t let go of that stuff.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a common experience with perfectionists—your mind is holding onto those details. Let’s try to reframe some of those thoughts. Can you recall what you tell yourself when you’re lying there anxious?  

Priya: Sometimes I think, “If I don’t get enough sleep, I’ll mess up tomorrow,” or “I should have prepared better.”  

Dr. Torres: Those are quite critical thoughts. We can work on challenging them with cognitive restructuring. But first, I want to check in on your sleep hygiene practices. Have you been maintaining the sleep restriction and stimulus control techniques we discussed?  

Priya: I’ve been trying. I’ve been going to bed around 11:00 PM and getting up at 6:30 AM, which is my target. But I still wake up during the night and sometimes go to the couch to try to fall back asleep.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Waking during the night is common, but staying in bed and trying to relax can help. How do you feel about doing a bit of stimulus control today?  

Priya: I’m willing to try. I want to improve.  

Dr. Torres: Great. Remember, the goal is to associate your bed with sleep only—so no screens or watching TV in bed, and if you’re awake after about 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet activity like reading or listening to calming music until you feel sleepy again.  

Priya: Okay, I can do that. Sometimes I get anxious about wasting time, though.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a normal worry. We’ll work on that next time. For now, let’s focus on the relaxation strategies. Have you been practicing the mindfulness exercises we discussed?  

Priya: Yes, I’ve been doing the breathing exercises before bed, but I notice my mind still races afterward.  

Dr. Torres: That’s very common. Sometimes, labeling your thoughts—like saying “planning” or “worry”—can help create distance from them. Would you like to try a brief mindfulness exercise now?  

Priya: Sure, I’d like that.  

**[01:10]**  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. Let’s do a quick body scan. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and focus on your breath. As you breathe in and out, notice any areas of tension. When your mind drifts, gently bring your attention back to your breath. Ready?  

(Pause for a moment as Priya follows the exercise.)  

Dr. Torres: How do you feel after that?  

Priya: Slightly calmer, I think. My body feels more relaxed.  

Dr. Torres: That’s great. Remember, this is a tool you can use whenever your mind feels overwhelmed. Now, looking at the bigger picture, how do you feel about your progress with sleep and stress management overall?  

Priya: Honestly, I think I’ve made some progress, but it’s still hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I get discouraged when I still wake up.  

Dr. Torres: That’s very understandable. Sleep issues can take time to resolve fully, especially with high stress and perfectionism involved. Our work over these sessions has been about building resilience and new habits. I see you’ve been consistent with your routines.  

Priya: Yeah, I’ve been trying. It’s just hard not to get caught up in the “all or nothing” thinking.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a good insight. We’ll continue working on that, especially challenging those perfectionistic thoughts. Before we wrap up today, let’s set some small, manageable goals for the week ahead.  

Priya: Okay.  

Dr. Torres: First, continue with your sleep schedule—aim for the same bedtime and wake time. Second, practice the relaxation and mindfulness exercises daily, especially before bed. And third, when you wake during the night, try getting out of bed and doing a quiet activity rather than lying awake. Does that sound doable?  

Priya: Yes, I can do that.  

Dr. Torres: Excellent. And next session, we’ll review how those strategies are working and explore any thoughts or feelings that come up. Keep track of your sleep and stress levels using your apps—they can give us helpful data.  

Priya: Will do. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Priya. Remember, progress is gradual, and you’re making important strides. I’ll see you next week.  

Priya: Looking forward to it. Thanks again.
