01:00 [01:00]  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more exhausted than usual, but I think I’ve been managing okay overall.  
Dr. Torres: Thanks for sharing. Last time, we talked about some sleep hygiene practices and work-related stress. Have you noticed any changes or patterns this week?  

01:10 [01:10]  
Priya: Yeah, I’ve been trying to stick to the sleep schedule we discussed, but some nights are still tough. I’ve been waking up around 3 or 4 am, and then I can't fall back asleep.  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Sleep issues can be persistent, especially with high stress. Did you notice any specific triggers or thoughts that come up during those restless nights?  
Priya: Sometimes I start thinking about work deadlines or emails I didn’t respond to. It’s like my mind just won’t turn off.  

01:20 [01:20]  
Dr. Torres: That’s quite common among high achievers, Priya. It sounds like your mind is quite active, which makes sense given your perfectionist tendencies. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or mindfulness before bed?  
Priya: I’ve done some deep breathing and a bit of meditation, but honestly, I find it hard to stay focused when my thoughts are racing.  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. Sometimes, starting with shorter, guided practices can help. We can also look at cognitive restructuring—identifying and challenging those work-related thoughts. Would you like to explore that now?  

01:30 [01:30]  
Priya: Yes, I think that might help.  
Dr. Torres: Great. Can you tell me about a specific thought that tends to come up at night?  
Priya: Well, I often think, “If I don’t respond to this email tonight, I’ll fall behind or miss out.”  
Dr. Torres: That’s a very common worry. Let’s examine that thought. Is it entirely accurate? What’s the evidence for and against this belief?  
Priya: Hmm. I guess I mostly worry about missing opportunities. But I also know that if I don’t sleep well, I won’t perform well tomorrow.  
Dr. Torres: Exactly. It sounds like a classic perfectionist thought pattern—overestimating the consequences of a missed response and undervaluing the importance of rest. How about reframing that thought?  
Priya: Maybe, “Missing one email tonight won’t ruin my progress. I can respond tomorrow, and I’ll still be capable.”  
Dr. Torres: That’s a very balanced reframe. How do you feel about adopting that as your bedtime mantra?  

01:40 [01:40]  
Priya: I like that. I think it could help ease my mind.  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. Incorporating that into your nightly routine might reduce the racing thoughts. Have you also been tracking your sleep patterns?  
Priya: Yes, I’ve been using my sleep app. The data shows I’m getting about 5 to 6 hours, but the quality isn’t great—lots of awakenings.  
Dr. Torres: Sleep quantity and quality are both important. Based on the data, do you think there are specific behaviors or habits during the day that could be affecting your sleep?  
Priya: I tend to work late, sometimes until 11 pm, and I’m on my phone a lot before bed.  
Dr. Torres: That’s a key point. The screen light and late hours can interfere with melatonin production. Have you considered a wind-down routine—like turning off screens an hour before bed and doing relaxing activities instead?  

01:50 [01:50]  
Priya: I’ve thought about it, but I often get caught up in work or social media. I’ll try to set a firm cutoff time.  
Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Setting a specific “digital sunset” can make a big difference. Also, you mentioned earlier that you find it hard to unwind—are there specific activities that help you relax?  
Priya: I enjoy listening to calming music or doing gentle stretches, but I don’t do them consistently.  
Dr. Torres: Consistency is key. Let’s plan for you to try a 10-minute stretching and listening to ambient music before bed tonight. How does that sound?  

02:00 [02:00]  
Priya: I can do that. It sounds manageable.  
Dr. Torres: Great. And just to recap, your action items are: one, reframe your work-related thoughts at bedtime; two, implement a digital cutoff an hour before sleep; and three, try the stretching and music routine tonight. How does that feel?  
Priya: Good. I think these steps are realistic, and I’m hopeful they’ll make a difference.  
Dr. Torres: Wonderful. Before our next session, keep tracking your sleep, noting any changes in quality or duration, and how you feel during the day. We’ll review your progress and adjust as needed.  

02:10 [02:10]  
Priya: Sounds like a plan. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  
Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Priya. Remember, change takes time, and small steps add up. I look forward to hearing how these new routines work out. See you next week!  
Priya: See you next week. (smiles softly)
