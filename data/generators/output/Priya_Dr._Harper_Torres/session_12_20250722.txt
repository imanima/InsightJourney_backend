01:00 [Start of Session]  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired this week, but I’ve also been trying to stick with the new sleep routines we discussed.  

01:05  
Dr. Harper Torres: That’s good to hear you’re maintaining the routines. Tiredness can be a sign that some adjustments might be needed. Can you tell me more about how your sleep has been overall?  
Priya: Well, I’ve been going to bed around the same time, like 11:30 PM, but I still wake up several times during the night, sometimes feeling restless. I check my sleep app and see that my sleep quality is still pretty low.  

01:10  
Dr. Harper Torres: It sounds like you’re doing a lot of the right things, but there’s still some fragmentation. Remember, sleep hygiene is a process—sometimes it takes time to see consistent improvements. Have you noticed any particular triggers or thoughts when you wake up at night?  
Priya: Mostly, I get anxious about not falling back asleep quickly. I start thinking about how important sleep is for my work, and then I worry I’ll be tired tomorrow.  

01:15  
Dr. Harper Torres: That’s a common pattern—your worries about performance and tiredness can create a cycle of anxiety that interferes with sleep. We can work on cognitive restructuring to challenge those thoughts. But first, I want to check in on your bedtime routine. Are you doing anything different before bed?  
Priya: I’ve been trying to avoid screens an hour before bed, which helps, but I still meditate and then lie in bed trying to relax. Sometimes I listen to calming music.  

01:20  
Dr. Harper Torres: That’s excellent. Using calming techniques is helpful. How about your environment? Is your bedroom conducive to sleep—dark, quiet, comfortable?  
Priya: Yes, I’ve made sure it’s dark and cool. I use blackout curtains and a white noise machine. But I’ve noticed that I sometimes still get thoughts about work deadlines or emails during the night.  

01:25  
Dr. Harper Torres: Those intrusive thoughts are common, especially in high-achievers like you. We can incorporate some mindfulness strategies to help you observe these thoughts without judgment, so they don’t keep you awake. Do you want to try a quick mindfulness exercise now?  
Priya: Sure, I can try that.  

[Brief pause for a guided mindfulness exercise]  

01:30  
Dr. Harper Torres: Great. How do you feel after that?  
Priya: A bit calmer, actually. It’s like I can see my thoughts more objectively.  

01:35  
Dr. Harper Torres: That’s a positive sign. Over time, practicing this regularly can help reduce the grip of those work-related thoughts at night. Now, earlier you mentioned waking up several times—do you keep a sleep diary or record these awakenings?  
Priya: Yes, I’ve been using my sleep app and noting when I wake up and what I was thinking about. It’s helpful to see patterns.  

01:40  
Dr. Harper Torres: Excellent. Data can be very insightful. Based on your records, do you notice any specific triggers or patterns when you wake?  
Priya: Mostly, I wake up around 2 or 3 AM and think about some project I’m behind on or an email I need to send. Sometimes I’m just anxious about my performance overall.  

01:45  
Dr. Harper Torres: That aligns with what we discussed—work stress fueling sleep disruptions. We can implement stimulus control techniques, like getting out of bed if you’re awake for more than 20 minutes, and doing a quiet activity until you feel sleepy again. Would you feel comfortable trying that?  
Priya: Yes, I think I can try that. It’s frustrating to just lie there awake.  

01:50  
Dr. Harper Torres: Absolutely, it’s frustrating, but it’s a proven method. Also, we can explore some cognitive restructuring to challenge those thoughts about being behind or not enough. For example, what evidence do you have that you’re falling behind?  
Priya: Well, I guess I tend to focus on what I haven’t finished rather than what I have. Sometimes I think if I don’t work late, I’ll fall behind.  

01:55  
Dr. Harper Torres: That’s a common perfectionist thought. Let’s reframe it: what’s a more balanced perspective?  
Priya: Maybe… that I can’t do everything at once, and I need to prioritize. If I don’t finish everything tonight, it’s okay to pick up where I left off tomorrow.  

02:00  
Dr. Harper Torres: Exactly. Recognizing that allows you to reduce the pressure and anxiety. Over time, this can help your sleep improve as your mind feels less overwhelmed. Do you feel ready to start integrating these strategies?  
Priya: Yes, I think so. I like the idea of challenging my thoughts and giving myself permission to rest.  

02:05  
Dr. Harper Torres: Great. For next steps, I’d like you to continue tracking your sleep and thoughts, practice the mindfulness exercises we did, and try the stimulus control if you wake during the night. Also, work on reframing those perfectionist beliefs. How does that sound?  
Priya: Sounds good. I’ll do my best. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

02:10  
Dr. Harper Torres: You’re doing very well, Priya. Remember, progress takes time. We’ll review how these strategies work over the next week. Anything else you want to bring up today?  
Priya: No, I think that covers it. Thank you.
