[01:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How has your week been since our last session? Anything new or noteworthy you’d like to start with?

[01:03] Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve still been struggling with sleep, especially with some late nights at work. But I did try to stick to the routines we discussed last time. 

[01:07] Dr. Torres: That’s good to hear you’re maintaining some routines. Can you tell me more about how those nights went? Were there specific challenges or successes?

[01:10] Priya: Well, I did manage to turn off screens earlier a few nights, around 10:30 pm, but I still find myself lying awake for a while. My mind keeps racing with work emails or upcoming deadlines. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m doing everything “right,” and yet sleep still eludes me.

[01:15] Dr. Torres: That’s a common experience, Priya. Even with good routines, stress and racing thoughts can interfere. It’s great you’re aware of your bedtime routine. Did you notice if the sleep hygiene tips we discussed, like limiting caffeine after noon, helped at all?

[01:17] Priya: Yes, I cut out caffeine after 2 pm, and I think that helped a little. I do notice I fall asleep slightly faster, but I wake up multiple times during the night, and then I can’t fall back asleep easily.

[01:22] Dr. Torres: That’s a good observation. Waking up during the night is common in insomnia, especially when stress is involved. Have you tried the relaxation techniques we practiced, like the progressive muscle relaxation or deep breathing, when you wake up?

[01:25] Priya: I did try deep breathing a couple of times, but honestly, I get so anxious about not sleeping that it’s hard to focus. Sometimes I start worrying about how I’ll feel the next day.

[01:28] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Worrying about sleep can create a cycle of anxiety, making it harder to fall back asleep. We can work on some cognitive restructuring to challenge those thoughts. Also, I’d like to revisit the stimulus control part of your sleep routine. Are you spending time in bed awake, or trying to force sleep?

[01:33] Priya: I’ve been trying not to stay in bed awake too long. If I can’t fall asleep within 20 minutes, I get up and do something calming, like reading a book. But sometimes I worry that getting up might make it worse.

[01:37] Dr. Torres: That’s a good strategy, Priya. The idea is to associate your bed with sleep, not frustration. Staying out of bed when awake helps the brain learn that the bed is for sleeping only. Over time, this can improve sleep onset. Do you notice any changes in how you feel during the day, like energy levels or mood?

[01:40] Priya: Honestly, I’m exhausted most days. I get through work, but I feel sluggish, and sometimes I get irritable. It’s affecting my productivity and my mood, which makes me more anxious about work.

[01:43] Dr. Torres: That’s very common with chronic sleep issues. Improving sleep can significantly boost your daytime functioning. Have you considered implementing a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends, to help regulate your circadian rhythm?

[01:47] Priya: I’ve been trying to wake up at 6:30 am every day, even on weekends, but I sometimes wake up earlier and can’t fall back asleep.

[01:50] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Waking up at the same time daily helps set your internal clock. If you wake early and can’t fall back asleep, do you get out of bed and do a quiet activity?

[01:53] Priya: Yes, I try to get up and do some light reading or listen to calming music. I avoid screens, of course.

[01:56] Dr. Torres: Excellent. That’s in line with stimulus control principles. How are you feeling emotionally about your sleep lately? Any feelings of frustration, anxiety, or hope?

[02:00] Priya: I’d say mostly frustration. I’m hopeful that with more consistent practice, I’ll see improvements, but it’s hard not to feel discouraged when I wake up tired.

[02:04] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Progress with sleep can be slow, especially with underlying stress. Remember, small consistent changes add up. Have you noticed any positive shifts or moments of relief this week?

[02:07] Priya: Well, I did manage to meditate for 10 minutes before bed a few nights, and I think it helped me relax a little. Also, I’ve been more mindful of my thoughts about sleep, trying to challenge the catastrophizing thoughts.

[02:12] Dr. Torres: That’s great progress. Cognitive restructuring and mindfulness are powerful tools. As we continue, I want us to focus on building a sustainable sleep plan, including sleep restriction therapy if appropriate, to gradually increase your sleep efficiency. Would you be comfortable with that approach?

[02:16] Priya: Yes, I’m willing to try anything that could help. I just want to feel more rested.

[02:19] Dr. Torres: That’s a good mindset. For next week, I’d like you to keep a sleep diary, noting your bedtime, wake time, night awakenings, and how you feel during the day. Also, continue practicing your relaxation and mindfulness techniques. We can review your progress and adjust as needed.

[02:23] Priya: Sounds good. I’ll do that.

[02:25] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Remember, Priya, small steps lead to big changes. I’m confident we’ll see some improvements soon. Anything else on your mind today?

[02:27] Priya: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your support.

[02:29] Dr. Torres: You’re welcome. I’ll see you next week, and in the meantime, keep up the good work. Take care.

[02:30] Priya: Thanks, Dr. Torres. Have a great day.
