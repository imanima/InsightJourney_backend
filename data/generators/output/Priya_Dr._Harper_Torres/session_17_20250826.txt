Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

01:00 [Session Begins]  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but I’ve been trying to stick to some of the routines we discussed.  

01:05  
Dr. Torres: That’s good to hear you’re maintaining your routines. Last time, we focused a lot on sleep hygiene and some cognitive strategies to manage work stress. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or stress levels?  
Priya: Well, I think I’ve been sleeping a little better, especially on nights I stick to the bedtime routine. But I still wake up a few times during the night, and mornings are still tough.  

01:10  
Dr. Torres: That’s a positive sign that some aspects are improving. Can you tell me about your current bedtime routine? Are there any particular steps you’re finding helpful or challenging?  
Priya: I’ve been trying to keep my phone away an hour before bed, and I do some breathing exercises. But sometimes I get caught up in work emails or thinking about upcoming meetings, and that makes it hard to unwind.  

01:15  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, especially given your high-achieving nature. Remember, part of the goal is to create a boundary between work and sleep. Have you noticed if those late-night work thoughts are making it harder to fall asleep?  
Priya: Definitely. Sometimes I lie in bed, and my mind just keeps racing about deadlines or things I forgot to do. It feels like I can’t turn it off.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s quite common with perfectionists. We can work on some cognitive restructuring to challenge those racing thoughts. But first, let’s revisit your sleep schedule. Have you been trying the sleep restriction therapy we discussed?  
Priya: I have, actually. I’ve been trying to go to bed at the same time each night, around 11:30 pm, and get up at 6:30 am. I think it’s helped me feel more tired at bedtime, but I still struggle some nights.  

01:25  
Dr. Torres: That’s progress. Sleep restriction can take time to fully stabilize your sleep patterns. How many nights have you been able to stick to that schedule consistently?  
Priya: About five nights out of seven. The weekends are a bit more flexible, so I tend to stay up later then.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: That’s quite normal. It’s good that you’re maintaining consistency during the week. Have you noticed any differences in your energy levels or mood during the day?  
Priya: I do feel a bit more rested during the day on the nights I stick to the schedule. But if I don’t, I wake up feeling groggy and anxious about my day ahead.  

01:35  
Dr. Torres: That’s encouraging. It shows your efforts are making an impact. Now, let’s talk about your work-related stress. Are there particular triggers or situations that tend to elevate your anxiety?  
Priya: Yes, especially when I have to present in meetings or make decisions quickly. I also worry about making mistakes or not being perfect enough.  

01:40  
Dr. Torres: Perfectionism can definitely amplify stress. Have you been able to apply any of the cognitive restructuring techniques we practiced to challenge those thoughts?  
Priya: I try to remind myself that mistakes are part of learning, but it’s still hard to shake the feeling that I should be doing everything perfectly. Sometimes I catch myself thinking, “If I mess up, I’ll be a failure.”  

01:45  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common automatic thought. We can work on reframing that to something more balanced, like, “Making mistakes doesn’t define my worth, and I can learn from them.” Would you like to practice that now?  
Priya: Yes, I think that would help.  

[Practices cognitive restructuring exercise]  

01:50  
Dr. Torres: Great. Now, considering your sleep and stress, how are you feeling emotionally overall today?  
Priya: I feel a bit more hopeful, honestly. Last week, I was feeling pretty overwhelmed, but talking through these things helps me see some progress. Still a lot to work on, but I’m feeling more motivated.  

01:55  
Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, change takes time, and every small step counts. For next week, I’d like you to continue with your sleep schedule and practice the cognitive restructuring when you notice those perfectionistic thoughts. Also, try to set a firm boundary for work emails after a certain time in the evening.  
Priya: I can do that. I’ll also try to stick to my bedtime routine more consistently, especially avoiding work thoughts before sleep.  

02:00  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. We’ll review how that goes next session. Before we finish, do you have any questions or anything you’d like to discuss?  
Priya: Not right now, but I appreciate the tools you’ve given me. It’s nice to feel like I’m making some progress.  

02:05  
Dr. Torres: I’m glad to hear that. Keep track of your sleep and stress levels through your apps, and we’ll look at your progress next time. Have a good week, Priya.  
Priya: Thanks, Dr. Torres. See you next week.
