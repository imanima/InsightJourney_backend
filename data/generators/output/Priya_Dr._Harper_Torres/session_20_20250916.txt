01:00 [Start of Session]
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more drained lately, even though I’ve been sticking to my sleep routine.  
Dr. Torres: I see. That’s interesting, especially since you’ve been actively working on your sleep habits. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on?  

01:05  
Priya: Well, I’ve been having trouble unwinding after work, especially with all the new projects at my firm. My mind just keeps racing, and I find myself lying in bed for hours.  
Dr. Torres: That sounds frustrating. In our last session, we talked about some relaxation techniques and a consistent bedtime routine. Have you been practicing those?  
Priya: I’ve tried, but honestly, it’s hard to switch off. I meditate, but my thoughts keep coming back to deadlines and emails I haven’t responded to.  

01:10  
Dr. Torres: That’s normal—stressful thoughts can be quite persistent. Let’s explore that a bit. When you notice your mind racing, what do you tell yourself?  
Priya: I tend to think, “I need to check that email again,” or “I should be doing more to prepare.” I guess I’m a perfectionist in my sleep as well as work.  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common pattern among high-achievers. Recognizing that is a good first step. Have you tried any cognitive restructuring around these thoughts?  

01:15  
Priya: Not specifically, no. I guess I just accept that I’ll be awake sometimes, but it’s frustrating.  
Dr. Torres: It’s understandable. We can work on challenging those perfectionistic thoughts. For example, if you think, “I must respond immediately,” we can examine the evidence for and against that. Would you like to try that now?  

Priya: Yeah, I think that might help.  
Dr. Torres: Great. So, what’s the evidence that you need to respond to emails immediately?  
Priya: Well, some colleagues expect quick replies, especially when there are urgent deals. If I don’t respond fast, I worry I might miss out or look unprofessional.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s a valid concern. But do you have any examples where delaying a response didn’t cause harm?  
Priya: Actually, yes. Last week, I delayed replying to an email by a few hours, and everything was fine. No one seemed upset.  
Dr. Torres: That’s helpful evidence. So, it’s possible that not replying instantly doesn’t always lead to negative outcomes. How does that sit with you?  
Priya: It’s reassuring, but I still feel anxious about it. Like, I should be faster to keep up.  

01:25  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common perfectionist thought—feeling you need to do everything perfectly and immediately. Over time, we can work on gradually reducing that pressure. Now, regarding sleep, how have your sleep hygiene practices been recently?  
Priya: I’ve been sticking to the routine—no screens an hour before bed, trying to keep a consistent schedule—but I still wake up multiple times during the night.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: And when you wake up, what do you usually do?  
Priya: I usually check my phone, scroll through emails or social media. Sometimes I try to do breathing exercises, but it’s hard to stay relaxed.  
Dr. Torres: Checking your phone can sometimes reinforce alertness, making it harder to fall back asleep. Have you tried the stimulus control technique—like leaving your phone outside the bedroom?  
Priya: I haven’t done that yet. I guess I’m still attached to it as a safety net.  

01:35  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. It’s a common challenge. We can set a gradual plan to disconnect from your phone before bed. Also, how are your sleep tracking apps informing your habits?  
Priya: They show I’m getting about 5 to 6 hours of sleep, but I still feel tired during the day. I think I need more than that.  
Dr. Torres: Sleep duration is important, but sleep quality matters too. We might consider a sleep restriction protocol—limiting time in bed to improve sleep efficiency. Would you be open to trying that?  

Priya: Yeah, I think I’d be willing to try. I want to feel more energized.  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. We’ll start with a sleep diary this week to track your sleep patterns more precisely, then adjust your time in bed accordingly.  

01:40  
Priya: Sounds good. I also wonder if my stress at work is making it harder to sleep. How do I balance unwinding without feeling guilty about work?  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common concern. Establishing clear boundaries—like a cutoff time for work emails and a relaxing pre-sleep routine—can help. Remember, taking time to unwind actually improves productivity when you’re working.  

01:45  
Priya: I see. Sometimes I feel guilty disconnecting, like I should be constantly available.  
Dr. Torres: Guilt can be a barrier, but it’s important to prioritize self-care. We can also work on cognitive restructuring around that guilt. For example, reminding yourself that rest enhances your performance and well-being.  

Priya: That makes sense. I want to get better at this because I know my sleep and stress are connected.  
Dr. Torres: Absolutely. Progress takes time, and you’re already making great strides. For next steps, I’d like you to implement the sleep diary, try leaving your phone outside the bedroom, and practice the cognitive restructuring we discussed for perfectionist thoughts.  

01:50  
Priya: Okay, I’ll do that. And I’ll also try to set a firm bedtime and avoid screens an hour before.  
Dr. Torres: Perfect. We’ll review how that goes in our next session. Remember, small consistent changes add up. Anything else on your mind today?  
Priya: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

01:55 [Wrap-up and Closure]  
Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Priya. I appreciate your openness. Keep track of your sleep and thoughts, and we’ll discuss your progress next week. Have a good rest of your day.  
Priya: Thanks, you too.
