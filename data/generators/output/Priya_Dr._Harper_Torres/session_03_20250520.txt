**[01:00]**  
**Dr. Harper Torres:** Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**[Priya:]** Hi, Harper. Honestly, I’ve been a bit better, but I still struggle with falling asleep most nights. I’ve been trying to stick to the routines we discussed, but some nights are tougher than others.  

**[01:05]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s completely understandable. Sleep can be quite persistent, especially when stress levels fluctuate. Could you tell me more about what’s been happening on the nights when sleep is particularly difficult?  

**[Priya:]** Well, I notice that I often get into bed, and then my mind just starts racing. I think about work deadlines, emails I haven’t responded to, or sometimes, just random worries that pop up. It’s like my brain refuses to shut off.  

**[01:10]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That sounds exhausting. You mentioned last time that you’re a perfectionist and tend to ruminate over work. Are you noticing any patterns in your thoughts when you lie down?  

**[Priya:]** Yeah, definitely. I keep replaying conversations I had during the day or obsess over minor mistakes I made at work. It’s like my mind refuses to let go.  

**[01:15]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s a common challenge, especially for high-achieving professionals like yourself. Last week, we discussed some cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge those perfectionist thoughts. Have you been able to practice any of those?  

**[Priya:]** I tried, but honestly, it’s hard to catch myself in the moment. Sometimes I notice the thoughts, but I feel so stuck in them that it’s hard to shift my perspective.  

**[01:20]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s a very normal experience—it takes practice. Remember, it’s about building the habit of noticing and gently challenging those thoughts. Have you tried any of the mindfulness exercises we talked about, like the body scan or deep breathing before bed?  

**[Priya:]** I’ve been doing the deep breathing, especially when I feel my mind racing. It helps a little, but I still have nights where I just can’t wind down fully.  

**[01:25]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s a good start. Sometimes, integrating a brief, calming routine before bed helps signal to your body that it’s time to relax. Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns on the nights when your sleep is worse?  

**[Priya:]** Actually, yes. I realize that if I’ve been working late, especially after 9 pm, it’s harder to fall asleep. Also, if I check my work email right before bed, it’s like my mind amps up even more.  

**[01:30]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s very insightful. It aligns with sleep hygiene principles—limiting screen time and work-related activities before bed can help reduce stimulation. We can work on refining your evening routines to support better sleep.  

**[Priya:]** Yeah, I think I need to be more disciplined with my phone and emails. I tend to keep checking even after I should be winding down.  

**[01:35]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Absolutely. Let’s revisit the stimulus control techniques. For example, reserving your bed for sleep and intimacy only, and setting a 'tech curfew' an hour before bed. How does that sound?  

**[Priya:]** That sounds doable. I’ve read about that, but I haven’t been consistent. I think I’ll try to turn off my devices earlier tonight.  

**[01:40]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Great. And I’d also like us to try a sleep restriction strategy—initially limiting time in bed to the average amount of sleep you’re currently getting, then gradually increasing it as your sleep improves. Have you tracked your sleep over the past week?  

**[Priya:]** Yes, I’ve been using my sleep app and journal. On average, I sleep about 5.5 to 6 hours, even though I aim for 8.  

**[01:45]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s valuable data. Implementing sleep restriction can help consolidate your sleep and reduce time awake in bed. It might feel restrictive at first, but it often leads to more restful sleep over time. Would you like to set a target for your sleep window for next week?  

**[Priya:]** Hmm, maybe I can aim for 6.5 hours initially? Like, going to bed at 11:30 pm and waking up around 6 am?  

**[01:50]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That sounds like a reasonable starting point. We can review your progress next week and adjust as needed. Remember, consistency is key.  

**[Priya:]** Okay, I’ll try that. I also want to ask about managing work stress during the day because I think that’s affecting my ability to wind down.  

**[01:55]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s a very important aspect. We can explore some stress management techniques—like scheduled breaks, cognitive reframing of work-related worries, or even brief mindfulness exercises at your desk. Have you tried any of these?  

**[Priya:]** I’ve been doing short meditation sessions during the day, but I sometimes forget or feel guilty taking breaks.  

**[02:00]**  
**Dr. Harper:** It’s common to feel guilty, but taking regular breaks actually improves productivity and reduces stress. Incorporating mindful pauses during your workday can help you detach and reset. Let’s also work on some cognitive strategies to reframe perfectionist thoughts that contribute to this stress.  

**[Priya:]** That would be helpful. I often think I need to be perfect all the time, which adds pressure.  

**[02:05]**  
**Dr. Harper:** That’s a common perfectionism pattern. Challenging those beliefs—reminding yourself that good enough is okay—is part of our work. Over the next week, I’d like you to notice when these thoughts come up and practice reframing them.  

**[Priya:]** Okay, I can do that. It’s just hard to shake the feeling sometimes.  

**[02:10]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Absolutely, change takes time. Overall, I see you making great efforts with the routines, and that’s commendable. Do you feel there’s anything else you want to focus on today?  

**[Priya:]** I think that covers most of it. I just want to keep working on my sleep and stress.  

**[02:15]**  
**Dr. Harper:** Excellent. For next week, let’s check in on your sleep restriction progress, your evening routines, and any thoughts or feelings that come up during your daytime stress management practices. Also, I’ll send you some mindfulness exercises to try during the day and before bed.  

**[Priya:]** Thanks, Harper. I appreciate the support.  

**[02:20]**  
**Dr. Harper:** You’re doing really well, Priya. Remember, progress is gradual. We’ll catch up again next week. Have a good rest of your day and good luck with your new routines.  

**[Priya:]** Thanks, I will. See you next week.
