[01:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[01:03] Priya: Hi Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been better. The sleep has still been pretty inconsistent, and I feel more exhausted than usual. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of stress and tiredness.

[01:05] Dr. Harper: I hear you. That exhaustion can really wear on you, especially when sleep isn’t restorative. Last time, we discussed some sleep hygiene strategies and introduced a sleep journal. Have you been tracking your sleep as we talked about?

[01:07] Priya: Yes, I’ve been using my sleep app every night. The patterns are still pretty erratic—some nights I sleep well, but most nights I wake up multiple times or can’t fall asleep at all.

[01:09] Dr. Harper: That’s helpful information. It’s common for sleep issues to fluctuate, especially with high stress. Let’s look at what might be contributing — are there specific stressors at work or in your personal life that might be impacting your sleep more lately?

[01:11] Priya: Definitely. Work has been more intense lately. We’re evaluating some new startup investments, and I feel a lot of pressure to get everything perfect. Sometimes I find myself obsessing over details even after hours, and that makes it hard to unwind.

[01:13] Dr. Harper: That perfectionism and overthinking can definitely interfere with sleep. Remember from our earlier sessions, how cognitive restructuring can help challenge these unhelpful thoughts? Would you like to try identifying some of these thoughts tonight before bed?

[01:15] Priya: Yeah, I think I can do that. I often tell myself I need to review every detail to avoid making a mistake, but it’s exhausting.

[01:17] Dr. Harper: That’s a common thought for high-achievers like yourself. A helpful exercise is to ask, “Is this thought entirely accurate?” or “What’s the evidence for and against this?” Would you like to practice that now?

[01:19] Priya: Sure.

[01:20] Dr. Harper: Okay. Think about the thought, “I need to review every detail to avoid mistakes.” What’s the evidence supporting this?

[01:22] Priya: Well, I’ve caught a few errors in the past when I was thorough. So, I guess it makes sense that reviewing everything helps.

[01:24] Dr. Harper: And what’s the evidence against it? Could there be a point where reviewing too much becomes counterproductive?

[01:26] Priya: Yeah, I suppose if I keep reviewing, I might never feel ready to close my work for the day. It’s like I’m never satisfied.

[01:28] Dr. Harper: Exactly. So, the thought “I need to review everything” might be an overgeneralization. A more balanced thought could be, “I can review my work thoroughly, but I need to set a limit to avoid overdoing it.” How does that feel?

[01:30] Priya: That sounds more reasonable. It takes off some of the pressure.

[01:32] Dr. Harper: Great. Now, let’s connect this to your sleep routines. Have you been practicing your stimulus control techniques, like only using the bed for sleep and intimacy, and going to bed when sleepy?

[01:34] Priya: I’ve tried, but I still find myself lying awake in bed, especially after waking up in the middle of the night. I scroll through my phone sometimes because I can’t fall back asleep.

[01:36] Dr. Harper: That’s very common. Using your phone can stimulate your brain and make it harder to sleep. Would you be willing to try a relaxation technique tonight if you wake up during the night? Something like diaphragmatic breathing or progressive muscle relaxation?

[01:38] Priya: Yeah, I think I can try that. The breathing exercises seem simple enough.

[01:40] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Remember, the goal is to calm your mind and body. Now, earlier you mentioned difficulty unwinding after work. Have you been able to implement any boundaries, like a set cutoff time or creating a transition ritual?

[01:42] Priya: I’ve been trying to leave my work notifications on silent after 7 PM, but I still find myself checking emails or thinking about work in the evening.

[01:44] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. Changing habits takes time. How about establishing a specific activity after work — like a short walk, journaling, or mindfulness meditation — to help you transition out of work mode?

[01:46] Priya: I could try journaling. I used to do that in college when I needed to clear my mind. Maybe that would help.

[01:48] Dr. Harper: That sounds like a great plan. Journaling can help offload thoughts and reduce rumination. Would you like to set a goal to do that daily, perhaps 10 minutes each evening?

[01:50] Priya: Yes, I can do that. It might help me process the day and stop my mind from racing at night.

[01:52] Dr. Harper: Perfect. So, to summarize, tonight you’ll practice cognitive restructuring if you notice stressful thoughts, use your relaxation techniques if you wake up, and start journaling after work to create a mental boundary. Does that sound manageable?

[01:54] Priya: Yes, that sounds good. I feel hopeful that these small steps will start making a difference.

[01:56] Dr. Harper: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress with sleep and stress management is often gradual. We’ll continue to monitor and adjust as needed. Next week, we can review how these strategies are working and explore any challenges.

[01:58] Priya: Thank you, Dr. Torres. I appreciate your support.

[02:00] Dr. Harper: You’re very welcome. Take care, Priya, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next week.
