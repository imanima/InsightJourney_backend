**[01:00]**  
**Dr. Harper Torres:** Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**Priya:** Hi, Dr. Torres. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired during the day, but I think I’ve been getting better at sticking to some of the routines we discussed.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s great to hear. You mentioned last time that your sleep was improving with the sleep hygiene techniques. Have you noticed any specific changes in your sleep patterns?  

**Priya:** Yeah, I’ve been going to bed around the same time most nights—around 11:30 or midnight—and I’ve been waking up fewer times. But I still sometimes have trouble falling asleep initially, especially after stressful days at work.  

**[01:10]**  
**Dr. Torres:** That’s a good sign of progress. Consistency helps. You mentioned trouble falling asleep after stressful days—can you tell me more about what’s going through your mind at that time?  

**Priya:** Usually, I start ruminating about work deadlines or some mistake I made. My mind just won’t shut off, and I end up lying there for an hour or more. It’s frustrating because I know I need sleep, but I feel stuck.  

**Dr. Torres:** That sounds very challenging. It’s common for work-related stress to interfere with sleep, especially for high-achievers like yourself. We can try some cognitive restructuring to challenge those thoughts. For example, when you think, “I won’t be able to perform tomorrow if I don’t sleep,” what’s another way to look at that?  

**Priya:** Maybe I could remind myself that one bad night won’t ruin everything, and I can still function tomorrow.  

**Dr. Torres:** Exactly. Reframing that thought can reduce some of the pressure. Have you been practicing any relaxation techniques before bed?  

**Priya:** I’ve tried some deep breathing, but I think I could be more consistent with it. Sometimes I forget or just feel too wired.  

**[01:20]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Consistency is key. Let’s revisit a brief relaxation routine you can do right before bed—maybe 5 minutes of diaphragmatic breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. Would you like me to guide you through a quick exercise now?  

**Priya:** Yes, please. That would help.  

**(Dr. Torres guides Priya through a 3-minute deep breathing exercise, emphasizing slow inhales and exhales, focusing on relaxing the muscles.)**  

**Priya:** That felt calming. I think I could do this every night.  

**Dr. Torres:** Great. Incorporating this into your routine might help ease your transition into sleep. How about your bedtime environment? Are there any changes you’ve made, or anything you want to improve?  

**Priya:** I’ve started reducing screen time about 30 minutes before bed. I read that it helps, but I still sometimes scroll on my phone if I can’t fall asleep right away.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a good start. As part of stimulus control, it’s best to avoid screens in bed. Maybe you could replace scrolling with a calming activity—like reading a physical book or listening to soft music.  

**Priya:** That makes sense. I’ll try that.  

**[01:30]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your work-related stress. You mentioned feeling anxious about deadlines and mistakes. How are you managing that stress during the day?  

**Priya:** I’ve been using some mindfulness exercises I found in an app, like quick breathing breaks during the day. They help a bit, but I still feel overwhelmed sometimes, especially when urgent emails pile up.  

**Dr. Torres:** It’s common to feel overwhelmed in such high-pressure environments. Have you considered setting boundaries—like designated 'work-free' times in the evening or after certain hours?  

**Priya:** I try, but honestly, I feel guilty if I stop working early. Plus, some emails come in late, and I feel I need to respond immediately.  

**Dr. Torres:** Guilt can be a barrier. Remember, setting boundaries is essential for your well-being. We can work on some assertiveness strategies to communicate your availability clearly. Also, prioritizing tasks and delegating when possible can reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.  

**Priya:** That’s true. I think I need to get better at saying no or pushing back on some requests.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a valuable skill. Let’s also revisit your sleep goals. You mentioned wanting to improve sleep quality and reduce insomnia symptoms. Do you feel you’re making progress toward those goals?  

**Priya:** I think so. The routine helps, and I’ve been more consistent, but I still wake up anxious sometimes. I guess I’m still working on fully calming my mind at night.  

**[01:40]**  
**Dr. Torres:** That’s understandable. Sleep is a process, and it takes time to see big changes. We can incorporate some mindfulness-based sleep techniques, like a brief body scan or guided imagery, to help quiet your mind. Would you like to try a quick body scan now?  

**Priya:** Sure, I’d like that.  

**(Dr. Torres guides Priya through a 2-minute body scan focusing on relaxing each part from head to toe.)**  

**Priya:** I feel more relaxed already. That might be a good way to wind down.  

**Dr. Torres:** I'm glad. Remember, combining these techniques with your existing routines can make a significant difference over time. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed today?  

**Priya:** Not right now. I think I just need to keep practicing and be patient.  

**Dr. Torres:** Absolutely. Consistency and patience are key. For next week, I want you to try adding the relaxation exercise and the stimulus control strategies consistently. Also, keep track of your sleep and any thoughts or feelings that come up before bed.  

**Priya:** Will do. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

**Dr. Torres:** Great work today, Priya. I’ll see you next week. Take care until then.  

**Priya:** Thanks, you too. Bye.
