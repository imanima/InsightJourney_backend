[01:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[01:02] Priya: Hi Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more stressed lately, especially with work. Sleep has been inconsistent — some nights I just can’t wind down, and others I wake up multiple times.

[01:04] Dr. Harper: That sounds tough. You've mentioned before that work stress tends to spill over into your nights. Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns lately?

[01:06] Priya: Well, I’ve been working on a big project that’s due next week. I tend to think about it even when I try to sleep. Plus, I’ve been checking my email late at night — I know I shouldn’t, but I can’t help it sometimes.

[01:08] Dr. Harper: It’s understandable, especially when deadlines feel pressing. You mentioned in previous sessions that your bedtime routine was somewhat inconsistent. Are you still struggling with that?

[01:10] Priya: Yes, I think so. I often stay up later than planned, scrolling through my phone or trying to relax but failing to actually wind down.

[01:12] Dr. Torres: Okay. It sounds like we need to revisit some sleep hygiene strategies and perhaps reinforce some boundaries around your evening habits. Last time, we discussed stimulus control and sleep restriction. How comfortable do you feel implementing those now?

[01:14] Priya: I think I can try. I’ve started setting a specific bedtime, but I still sometimes check my phone, especially when I wake up during the night.

[01:16] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. Remember, the goal of stimulus control is to associate your bed with sleep and relaxation only, so avoiding activities like phone use there helps. Would you like us to work on a specific plan for tonight?

[01:18] Priya: Yes, please. I really want to improve, but I keep falling back into old habits.

[01:20] Dr. Torres: Great. Let’s set a bed time of 11:30 PM tonight. Before bed, avoid screens for at least 30 minutes. Instead, try a calming activity like reading a paperback or listening to gentle music. During the night, if you wake up, try not to check your phone — instead, use a relaxation technique like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.

[01:22] Priya: That makes sense. I’ll try that tonight.

[01:24] Dr. Torres: Excellent. How about your stress management? You’ve mentioned work is high-pressure right now. Are you still using mindfulness or other techniques to help unwind?

[01:26] Priya: I’ve been doing short meditation sessions in the morning, but I haven’t been consistent in the evening. I think I get too wired after work.

[01:28] Dr. Torres: Consistency is key. Maybe integrating a brief mindfulness practice before bed could help signal to your brain that it’s time to relax. Would you be open to trying a 10-minute guided meditation each night?

[01:30] Priya: Yeah, I can do that. I have a meditation app I use sometimes.

[01:32] Dr. Torres: Perfect. Let’s set a goal to do that tonight and see how it impacts your ability to wind down. Also, how are you feeling about setting boundaries around work emails? You mentioned checking them late at night.

[01:34] Priya: I’ve been trying to resist, but I still sometimes look at my phone when I wake up. It’s hard not to check if something urgent came in.

[01:36] Dr. Torres: It’s a common challenge. Remember, part of our work here is to reduce that association between your bed and work-related stress. Perhaps, setting a specific "tech curfew" an hour before sleep could help. Would you like to try that starting tonight?

[01:38] Priya: Yes, I think I can do that. It might help me disconnect a bit more.

[01:40] Dr. Torres: Great. So, tonight, your plan is to have an 11:30 PM bedtime, avoid screens 30 minutes before, do a 10-minute meditation, and resist checking work email after 9:00 PM. How does that sound?

[01:42] Priya: It sounds manageable. I’ll give it a try.

[01:44] Dr. Torres: Wonderful. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on your progress with cognitive strategies. Last time, we identified some perfectionist thoughts about needing to "perform" perfectly at work. Have you noticed any patterns or tried to challenge those thoughts?

[01:46] Priya: Yes. I’ve caught myself thinking that if I don’t check every detail, I’ll mess up or be seen as inadequate. I’ve been trying to remind myself that mistakes are part of learning and that I don’t need to be perfect.

[01:48] Dr. Torres: That’s a valuable insight. Practicing cognitive restructuring here can help reduce the anxiety linked to those thoughts. How about writing down any perfectionist thoughts during the week and challenging them with evidence?

[01:50] Priya: I can do that. I started a journal for that purpose.

[01:52] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Keep tracking those thoughts, and we’ll review them next time. Overall, it seems you’re making good progress with your sleep routines and managing work stress. Remember, change takes time, and small steps add up.

[01:54] Priya: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel more hopeful about improving my sleep and reducing stress.

[01:56] Dr. Torres: I’m glad to hear that. For next week, let’s focus on implementing tonight’s plan and reviewing your thought journal. We’ll also check in on how your mindfulness practice is going. Any questions before we finish?

[01:58] Priya: Not right now. Thanks for the guidance. I’ll let you know how tonight goes.

[02:00] Dr. Torres: Looking forward to hearing about it. Have a restful evening, Priya. See you next week.

[02:02] Priya: Thank you. See you then.
