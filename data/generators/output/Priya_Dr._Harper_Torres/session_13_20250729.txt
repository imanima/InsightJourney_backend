01:00  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but I think that’s partly due to my sleep issues. Work has been intense lately, so I haven't been sleeping well.  

01:05  
Dr. Torres: That sounds challenging. You mentioned last time that your sleep quality was improving with some new routines. Could you tell me more about how things have been with your sleep this week?  
Priya: Yeah, I’ve been trying to stick to the sleep schedule we discussed—going to bed around 11:00 PM and waking up at 6:30 AM. But on some nights, I still find myself lying awake for a while, especially after stressful days.  

01:10  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common experience, especially with work stress. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make it harder to fall asleep?  
Priya: Usually, it’s when I’ve had a particularly demanding day, or I get caught up in last-minute emails or planning for upcoming meetings. My mind just won’t shut off.  

01:15  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. We’ve talked about some cognitive techniques to manage racing thoughts, like journaling or mindfulness. Have you been practicing any of those?  
Priya: I’ve tried journaling for a few minutes before bed, but I haven’t been very consistent. Sometimes I get too tired or distracted. I also started a short mindfulness meditation app, but I’m not sure if it’s making much difference yet.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s okay; consistency takes time. Remember, even brief mindfulness exercises can help over time. Let’s explore that a bit—what do you notice when you practice the meditation? Do you experience any particular thoughts or feelings?  
Priya: Honestly, my mind still wanders a lot during meditation. I get frustrated because I want it to be perfect, but I guess that’s part of the process. I do feel a little calmer afterwards, though.  

01:25  
Dr. Torres: That’s a great observation. Mindfulness is about acceptance, not perfection. The fact that you notice a calming effect even if your mind wanders is a positive sign. Now, in terms of your sleep hygiene, how have your routines around the bedroom been? Are you keeping the bed for sleep and intimacy only?  
Priya: I’ve been trying to avoid work in bed, but sometimes I still check my phone if I wake up during the night. I know I should resist it, but it’s hard to break that habit.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge. How about stimulus control—using the bed only for sleep and intimacy to strengthen your sleep association?  
Priya: I’ve read about that. I think I need to set a rule for myself—no phone in bed, and if I don’t fall asleep within 20 minutes, I should get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again.  

01:35  
Dr. Torres: Exactly. That’s a good plan. It helps reduce anxiety about falling asleep and conditions your body to associate the bed with sleep rather than wakefulness. How does that sound to you?  
Priya: It makes sense. I’ll give it a try. I also want to work on my work-life boundaries—sometimes I feel guilty disconnecting from work, but I know I need to.  

01:40  
Dr. Torres: Setting boundaries is key, especially for reducing stress. Have you considered a specific wind-down routine in the evening that signals to your brain it’s time to relax?  
Priya: Not really, but I suppose I could start with turning off all devices an hour before bed and doing some light stretching or reading instead.  

01:45  
Dr. Torres: That’s a great start. Incorporating relaxing activities can help ease your transition into sleep. Going back to work-related anxiety, how are you managing those thoughts during the day?  
Priya: I’ve been trying to challenge perfectionist thoughts—reminding myself that I don’t need to be perfect all the time and that mistakes are normal. But it’s still hard to fully believe that.  

01:50  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common struggle. Cognitive restructuring can help you reframe those thoughts. For example, when you think, “I must be perfect,” you might challenge it with, “Doing my best is enough,” or “Mistakes are opportunities to learn.” Have you tried any specific affirmations?  
Priya: Not yet, but I can try to develop some. I think having a few written down might help me remind myself during stressful moments.  

01:55  
Dr. Torres: Absolutely. Creating a set of personalized affirmations could reinforce more balanced thinking. As we approach the end of our session, I’d like us to set some concrete goals for the next week. What feels most important for you right now?  
Priya: I think I want to focus on sticking with my sleep routine, especially avoiding phone use in bed, and practicing my mindfulness meditation daily.  

02:00  
Dr. Torres: Great priorities. Also, remember to keep a sleep diary to track what’s working and where challenges still arise. We’ll review that next week. And perhaps try a few of those cognitive restructuring exercises during the day when work stress peaks.  
Priya: That sounds good. I’m feeling more hopeful, even if I still have some setbacks. Thanks for your support.  

02:05  
Dr. Torres: You’re doing really well, Priya. Progress takes time, but you’re making meaningful changes. I’ll see you next week, and in the meantime, reach out if you need any support.  
Priya: Thanks, Dr. Torres. See you next week!
