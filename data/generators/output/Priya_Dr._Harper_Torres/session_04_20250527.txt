Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[01:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[01:02] Priya: Hey, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The insomnia is still pretty persistent, and I’ve noticed my stress levels at work haven’t really decreased. Sometimes I feel like I’m just running in place.

[01:04] Dr. Torres: That sounds frustrating, especially since we’ve been working on your sleep and stress management. Can you tell me more about what’s been most challenging lately?

[01:06] Priya: Well, even with the routines we set up, I find it hard to unwind after work. My mind keeps racing, and I end up scrolling through emails or checking my phone late into the night. Sleep quality is still poor—I wake up multiple times, and I feel tired during the day.

[01:08] Dr. Torres: It sounds like your bedtime routine isn’t quite helping you wind down as much as you'd like. Have you noticed any particular triggers that make it harder to relax?

[01:10] Priya: Mostly, I think it’s work-related stuff. I get caught up in trying to perfect everything, and that makes it hard to switch off mentally. Also, I’ve been feeling more anxious about upcoming deadlines, which doesn’t help.

[01:12] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable, especially given your perfectionist tendencies. Last time, we talked about implementing some stimulus control techniques and sleep restriction. How have you been doing with those?

[01:14] Priya: I’ve been trying, but it’s still a challenge. I’ve been limiting my time in bed to about 6.5 hours, but I often find myself awake in the middle of the night, worrying about work stuff. My sleep tracker shows fragmented sleep, which confirms I’m not getting enough restorative sleep.

[01:16] Dr. Torres: It’s good that you’re tracking these patterns—that gives us concrete data. Remember, sleep restriction is a gradual process. Are you comfortable with perhaps tightening your time in bed a bit more, or would you like to revisit some relaxation exercises to enhance your ability to fall asleep?

[01:18] Priya: I think revisiting relaxation techniques might help. I’ve been doing deep breathing, but maybe I need more structured practices like progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation before bed.

[01:20] Dr. Torres: That’s a great idea. Incorporating mindfulness or progressive muscle relaxation could help signal to your body that it’s time to wind down. Would you like to try a quick exercise now?

[01:22] Priya: Sure, I’d like that.

(Dr. Torres guides Priya through a brief 3-minute progressive muscle relaxation exercise, focusing on releasing tension from her shoulders down to her legs.)

[01:25] Priya: (sighs softly) That felt nice. I can see how it might help me relax more before bed.

[01:27] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Consistent practice can make a big difference. Now, thinking about your work stress—have you been able to set clearer boundaries, like designated work hours or tech-free time in the evening?

[01:29] Priya: I’ve tried, but honestly, I still check my email late at night. My phone is always nearby, and I feel guilty stepping away from my tasks. I know it’s not ideal.

[01:31] Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge, especially with high-achieving personalities. Let’s explore some cognitive restructuring around this. For example, what thoughts come up when you consider disconnecting from work at a set time?

[01:33] Priya: I often think, “If I don’t check now, I’ll miss something important,” or “I can’t afford to fall behind.” I worry that taking a break will make me look less dedicated.

[01:35] Dr. Torres: Those are understandable concerns. But we can challenge those thoughts. For instance, what evidence do you have that checking emails late at night actually improves your work outcomes? And what might be the costs of staying connected when you’re supposed to be unwinding?

[01:37] Priya: Well, honestly, checking late doesn’t seem to help. If anything, I end up feeling more anxious and less rested. And I know I perform better during the day when I’ve had good sleep.

[01:39] Dr. Torres: Exactly. Recognizing that can help reinforce the habit of disconnecting. Let’s also set some specific boundaries—like turning off work notifications an hour before bed—and then gradually work on reducing that time.

[01:41] Priya: That makes sense. I think I can start with that tonight.

(Brief pause as Priya reflects)

[01:43] Dr. Torres: Great. To summarize, today we focused on refining your relaxation techniques, addressing work-related stress through cognitive restructuring, and setting clearer boundaries. How are you feeling about implementing these strategies?

[01:45] Priya: I feel optimistic. It’s helpful to have concrete actions. I know I need to be patient, but I want to see some progress in my sleep and stress levels.

[01:47] Dr. Torres: That’s a good mindset. Remember, progress can be gradual, and consistency is key. For next week, let’s check in on how these boundary-setting efforts go and whether the relaxation exercises are helping with your sleep.

[01:49] Priya: Sounds good. I’ll keep tracking my sleep and try to stick to the routines.

[01:51] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Before we finish, is there anything else you’d like to address today?

[01:53] Priya: Not right now, I think we covered a lot. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate the support.

[01:55] Dr. Torres: You’re very welcome, Priya. Keep practicing those techniques, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Take care until then.

[01:57] Priya: Will do. Thanks again. Bye!

[01:59] Dr. Torres: Goodbye, Priya. Have a good rest of your day.
