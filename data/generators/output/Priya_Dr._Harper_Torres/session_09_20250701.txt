Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

01:00  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more fatigued than usual, especially during the mornings. My sleep has been inconsistent, and I’ve noticed it’s affecting my focus during work.  

01:10  
Dr. Torres: I appreciate you sharing that. Last time, we discussed some sleep hygiene practices and mindfulness exercises. Have you been able to implement any of those routines?  
Priya: Yes, I’ve tried to stick to a more regular bedtime, around 11:30 PM, and I’ve been using the meditation app you recommended. Sometimes I fall asleep faster, but other nights I still struggle to wind down.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s a positive step. It’s common to have fluctuations initially. Can you tell me more about what your bedtime routine looks like?  
Priya: Sure. I usually finish work around 10:30 PM, then I dim the lights, do a 10-minute meditation, and read a book for about 15 minutes. But my mind often drifts back to work worries, especially if I have upcoming deadlines.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: It sounds like your mind is still quite active at night. Have you noticed specific thoughts or worries that tend to keep you awake?  
Priya: Yes, mainly about whether I’m meeting expectations or if I missed something important during the day. Sometimes I ruminate over emails or meetings.  

01:40  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common challenge for high-achievers like yourself. We can work on cognitive restructuring to help address those worries. But first, let’s revisit some sleep strategies. Are you currently using the sleep restriction technique we discussed?  
Priya: Not consistently. I find it hard to limit my time in bed because I feel tired and worry that I won’t get enough rest.  

01:50  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Remember, sleep restriction is about consolidating sleep so it becomes more efficient. We can start gradually by limiting your time in bed to your average sleep time, which I believe from your sleep logs is around 5.5 hours. Would you be comfortable trying to keep your bedtime at 11:30 PM and wake-up time at 5:00 AM for a week?  
Priya: Yeah, I think I can try that. It feels a bit intimidating, but I’m willing to give it a shot.  

02:00  
Dr. Torres: Good. And during the day, it’s helpful to get some exposure to natural light, especially in the morning, to reinforce your circadian rhythm. Have you been able to do that?  
Priya: Not as much as I’d like. I usually start working right away and don’t step outside until lunchtime.  

02:10  
Dr. Torres: Let’s aim to add at least 10-15 minutes outside in the morning this week. Even a short walk or just sitting in sunlight can help. Now, regarding your work-related worries, I’d like to introduce some cognitive techniques. Would you be open to trying a thought-challenging exercise?  
Priya: Yes, I’d like that. Sometimes I tell myself I need to be perfect or else I’ll fail. It’s exhausting.  

02:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s a very common perfectionist thought. A useful strategy is to examine the evidence for and against that belief. For example, what evidence do you have that missing a small detail will lead to failure?  
Priya: Well, I guess I’ve missed minor things before, but nothing catastrophic has happened. Most issues get caught eventually.  

02:30  
Dr. Torres: Exactly. Recognizing that small mistakes are normal and don’t define your overall performance can help reduce anxiety. How does that feel to you?  
Priya: A bit relieving, honestly. It’s like giving myself permission to be human.  

02:40  
Dr. Torres: That’s a great insight. Also, during the day, when work stress ramps up, it can help to pause and do a quick mindfulness check. Even a 2-minute breathing exercise can reset your focus. Would you like to practice one now?  
Priya: Sure, I’d like that.  

02:50  
(They do a brief guided breathing exercise, focusing on deep inhales and slow exhales.)  

03:00  
Dr. Torres: How do you feel after that?  
Priya: More centered. I think I should try to incorporate these mini-breaks more often.  

03:10  
Dr. Torres: That’s excellent. Small, consistent practices can make a big difference over time. To summarize, this week, let’s focus on:  
- Experimenting with sleep restriction at 11:30 PM to 5:00 AM.  
- Getting outside in the morning for natural light.  
- Challenging perfectionist thoughts about work.  
- Practicing brief mindfulness breaks during the day.  

Priya: That sounds doable. I appreciate having clear steps.  

03:20  
Dr. Torres: Wonderful. How are you feeling about your progress and the upcoming week?  
Priya: More hopeful. It’s helpful to break things down and have specific actions. I know sleep and stress are connected, so I’ll keep working on both.  

03:30  
Dr. Torres: That’s a great mindset. Remember, consistency is key. We’ll review how these strategies work next session. Anything else you want to address today?  
Priya: No, I think that covers it for now. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

03:40  
Dr. Torres: You’re very welcome. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a good rest of your day.  
Priya: Thanks, you too.  

03:50  
(End of session.)
