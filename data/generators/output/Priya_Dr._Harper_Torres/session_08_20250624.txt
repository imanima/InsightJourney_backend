01:00 [Start of Session]

Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

Priya: Hi Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more exhausted, but I think I’ve managed to stick to some of the sleep routines we discussed. Still, waking up multiple times during the night is frustrating.

Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. It sounds like you’ve been making an effort to implement the sleep hygiene practices we talked about. Can you tell me more about your sleep pattern lately? How many times are you waking up, and what’s happening when you do?

Priya: Sure. I usually fall asleep around 11:30 PM, but I wake up around 2 or 3 AM and then again around 5 AM. Sometimes I can’t fall back asleep, and other times I doze off again after lying awake for a while. It’s like my mind keeps racing with work stuff and worries.

Dr. Torres: That’s quite common with high-achievers like you—your mind tends to stay active even when you’re trying to rest. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or concerns that come up during those wakeful periods?

Priya: Yes, mostly about deadlines or upcoming meetings. I also replay moments from the day, trying to make sure I didn’t miss anything or could have done better.

Dr. Torres: That sounds very familiar. It’s a classic perfectionist pattern—racing thoughts about performance and fear of missing out. Have you tried any techniques lately to calm those thoughts?

Priya: I’ve attempted some deep breathing and mindfulness exercises I found on my meditation app, but honestly, they don’t seem to help much when I’m already awake and anxious.

Dr. Torres: That’s insightful. Sometimes, the techniques need to be more targeted, especially during those middle-of-the-night awakenings. Last time, we discussed stimulus control and sleep restriction. How have you been applying those?

Priya: I’ve been trying to go to bed only when I feel sleepy and get up at the same time every morning, even on weekends. I also avoided working in bed and kept my phone out of reach.

Dr. Torres: That’s excellent progress. How has that affected your sleep onset and quality?

Priya: It’s a bit better. I fall asleep a little faster now, around 11:15 PM instead of 11:30, but I still wake up during the night. Sometimes it feels like I’m just waiting for sleep to come again.

Dr. Torres: It’s a step forward, and overnight awakenings are common in sleep improvement. The key is how you respond to those awakenings. When you wake up, what do you usually do?

Priya: I try to relax, but often I start worrying about work or replaying things. I sometimes get up and read or check my phone, although I know that’s not ideal.

Dr. Torres: Right, that’s important to recognize. Using the phone or reading can reinforce wakefulness. For your next week, I’d like us to try a specific cognitive strategy during those wakeful moments—specifically, a thought-challenging exercise. When you notice racing thoughts, you can ask yourself, “Is this worry something I can solve right now?” or “Is this thought based on facts or assumptions?”

Priya: I can try that. It sounds logical, but I’m worried I might forget during the moment.

Dr. Torres: That’s normal. To help, you can keep a small notepad or a voice memo device by your bed. When you wake up, quickly jot down the thought and then do the questioning exercise. Over time, this can train your brain to respond differently to those worries.

Priya: That makes sense. I’ll give it a shot.

Dr. Torres: Great. Now, let’s discuss your work-related stress. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times. Have you been able to set clearer boundaries between work and personal time?

Priya: I’ve been trying, especially after our last session. I’ve started turning off notifications after 7 PM and not checking emails on weekends. It helps, but I still get anxious if I see a work message pop up unexpectedly.

Dr. Torres: That’s good progress. Sometimes, the anxiety around missing something can be persistent. Have you considered formally scheduling “worry time” during the day—say, 15 minutes where you allow yourself to process work concerns, so they don’t spill over into your evenings and nights?

Priya: I haven’t, but that might help. I often find myself ruminating all evening, which keeps me from relaxing.

Dr. Torres: Exactly. Allocating specific worry time can contain those thoughts and reduce their impact on your sleep. Also, using a mindfulness practice during the day—such as a brief body scan or breathing exercise—can increase your overall sense of calm.

Priya: I’d like to try that. I’ve been so focused on data and productivity that I forget to pause.

Dr. Torres: It’s common among high-achievers. Remember, taking intentional breaks can actually improve your efficiency and reduce stress in the long run. Now, looking back over the past few weeks, what’s been your biggest success with your sleep or stress management?

Priya: Honestly, sticking to a consistent wake-up time and avoiding screens in bed has helped me feel a bit more in control. I’m also more aware of my thoughts and trying to challenge them.

Dr. Torres: That’s fantastic progress. Recognizing and implementing these changes is a big step. As we move forward, I’d like you to continue practicing the thought-challenging exercises during nighttime awakenings and schedule worry periods during the day. Also, keep tracking your sleep and stress levels with your apps so we can review your data next time.

Priya: Will do. I appreciate the guidance. It feels good to have some practical tools to work with.

Dr. Torres: I’m glad to hear that. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions or anything else you want to discuss?

Priya: Not today, but I’ll keep working on these strategies and let you know how it goes.

Dr. Torres: Excellent. Our next session will be in a week, and we can review your progress. Keep up the great work, Priya. Remember, small consistent steps lead to meaningful change.

Priya: Thank you, Dr. Torres. See you next week.
