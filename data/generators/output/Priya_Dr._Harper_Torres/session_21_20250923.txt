Session 21/24
Date: September 23, 2025
Time: 01:00 PM
Client: Priya (VC Analyst)
Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

01:00  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it’s good to see you again. How have you been this past week?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been intense, and I’ve been struggling with my sleep again.  

01:05  
Dr. Torres: I appreciate your honesty. Let’s start by checking in on your sleep habits. Have you noticed any particular patterns or changes since our last session?  
Priya: Well, I’ve been trying to stick to my new bedtime routine, but I still find myself lying in bed for hours sometimes, ruminating about work stuff. I also had a couple of nights where I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn’t fall back asleep.  

01:10  
Dr. Torres: That sounds frustrating. When you say “ruminating,” what kinds of thoughts tend to come up?  
Priya: Mostly, I worry about deadlines, whether I’m meeting expectations, or if I’ve missed something important. It’s like my mind keeps replaying work scenarios, and I can’t seem to turn it off.  

01:15  
Dr. Torres: That’s quite common, especially for high-achievers like you. It’s good that you’re aware of these thoughts. Let’s explore some cognitive restructuring techniques to help challenge those work-related worries when they come up at night. Would you like to try a quick exercise now?  
Priya: Sure, I’m open to it.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: Great. Think about a recent work worry that’s been bothering you. Can you describe it briefly?  
Priya: Yeah, I’ve been concerned that I didn’t get enough time to review a presentation, and I keep thinking I might have missed something critical.  

01:25  
Dr. Torres: Okay. Now, let’s examine that thought. What’s the evidence supporting the idea that you missed something?  
Priya: Well, I did rush a bit to finish it, but I double-checked all the data and had my manager review it. Still, I keep feeling unsure.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: And what’s the evidence against that thought?  
Priya: My manager approved it, and I received positive feedback last time I submitted work. Plus, I tend to be very thorough — I usually catch most issues myself.  

01:35  
Dr. Torres: So, the evidence suggests that your concern might be an overgeneralization or perfectionism kicking in. Would you agree?  
Priya: Yeah, I guess so. I often think if it’s not perfect, I’ve failed.  

01:40  
Dr. Torres: That’s a helpful insight. Challenging perfectionistic thoughts can reduce anxiety over time. Now, let’s shift focus a bit. You mentioned struggling with lying in bed for hours. How has your sleep hygiene been lately?  
Priya: I’ve been sticking to the routine I set up—no screens an hour before bed, doing some light reading, and keeping the room cool. But I still find my mind racing.  

01:45  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Sometimes, despite good habits, the mind needs additional strategies like relaxation techniques. Have you tried any relaxation exercises before bed recently?  
Priya: I’ve done some breathing exercises, but I haven’t been consistent. Honestly, I feel like I need more effective ways to unwind.  

01:50  
Dr. Torres: Let’s revisit a simple progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation. Would you like to try a brief guided exercise now?  
Priya: Yes, I’d like to try that.  

(Dr. Torres guides Priya through a 2-minute mindfulness exercise, focusing on breath awareness and body relaxation.)  

02:00  
Priya: That was calming. I can see how it might help reduce my racing thoughts.  
Dr. Torres: I’m glad. Incorporating a short mindfulness practice nightly could be beneficial. Also, we might consider adjusting your sleep restriction schedule to align better with your current sleep patterns. How is your sleep diary looking?  
Priya: I’ve been logging consistently. I notice I tend to go to bed around 11:30 pm but sometimes wake up around 2 or 3 am and can’t fall back asleep for a while.  

02:05  
Dr. Torres: That’s valuable information. Based on that, we can implement some stimulus control strategies — like getting out of bed if you can’t sleep after 20 minutes, and doing a quiet activity until you feel sleepy again. Would you be comfortable trying that?  
Priya: Yes, I think that might help. It’s frustrating lying there awake, so I’d be willing to try.  

02:10  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. Over the next week, I’d like you to monitor how implementing these strategies impacts your sleep. Also, continue using your sleep diary, noting what time you go to bed, wake up, and any awakenings.  

Priya: Will do. I’ve been tracking my sleep with my app, but I’ll make sure to add notes about my thoughts and activities before bed.  

02:15  
Dr. Torres: Perfect. Before we wrap up today, let’s briefly review your goals. You wanted to improve your sleep quality, develop better bedtime routines, and reduce work-related anxiety. How do you feel about your progress so far?  
Priya: I think I’ve made some progress with understanding my thoughts and trying relaxation techniques. Sleep still isn’t perfect, but I feel more equipped to handle the racing mind now.  

02:20  
Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, change takes time, especially with sleep issues linked to anxiety. Our work on cognitive restructuring and relaxation will continue to build resilience. Next session, we’ll review your sleep diary and adjust strategies as needed.  

Priya: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate the tools and support. It feels good to have some concrete steps to work on.  

02:25  
Dr. Torres: You’re doing great, Priya. Keep practicing these techniques, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you experience a particularly difficult night. I’ll see you next week.  

Priya: Sounds good. See you then.
