Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, good to see you again. How has your week been? Any notable changes or experiences since our last session?  

Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. It's good to see you too. Honestly, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been trying to stick to the sleep routines we discussed, but some nights are better than others.  

Dr. Torres: That’s quite common when making changes to sleep habits. Let’s start by reviewing how your sleep tracking has been going. Have you noticed any patterns or surprises?  

Priya: Well, I’ve been using my sleep app religiously, and I noticed that on nights I feel more anxious about work, I tend to wake up multiple times. Last night, I was awake for almost an hour around 3 AM.  

[01:10]  
Dr. Torres: That’s insightful. It sounds like work-related stress is definitely influencing your sleep. Did you try any of the relaxation techniques we discussed last time before bed?  

Priya: I tried a few breathing exercises and some mindfulness meditation, but honestly, my mind kept racing. I think I’m still struggling with unwinding fully.  

Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Sometimes, the mind needs more practice to shift into a relaxed state, especially if stress is high. Would you be open to incorporating a brief cognitive restructuring exercise before bed to address some of the anxious thoughts?  

Priya: Yeah, I think that could help. I often have this recurring thought that if I don’t get enough sleep, I’ll fall behind at work or miss out on opportunities.  

[01:20]  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common perfectionist thought—linking your self-worth to productivity. Let’s challenge that a bit. Can you reframe that thought? Maybe something like, “While sleep is important, I can still perform well even if I have a rough night occasionally.”  

Priya: I see. I guess I tend to think that missing sleep is like failing, but maybe that’s not entirely true.  

Dr. Torres: Exactly. It’s about building a more balanced perspective. How does that reframing feel for you?  

Priya: It feels a little relieving, honestly. Like I’m giving myself permission to not be perfect every night.  

[01:30]  
Dr. Torres: That’s a great step. Now, considering your recent nights of waking, have you tried any stimulus control techniques, like going to bed only when sleepy or getting out of bed if you can’t sleep?  

Priya: I’ve been trying to go to bed at the same time, around 11:30 PM, but I do tend to stay in bed awake, hoping I’ll fall asleep. Sometimes I get up around 2 or 3 AM and read or just sit in the dark.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. The goal is to strengthen the association between bed and sleep. If you’re awake for too long, getting out of bed and doing something relaxing—like reading a non-stimulating book—can help. Have you noticed any difference when you do that?  

Priya: Actually, yes. Last night, I got up, read for about 15 minutes, then went back to bed, and I managed to fall asleep faster.  

Dr. Torres: That’s excellent progress. It’s small, but it’s building good habits. Let’s also explore your bedtime routine. You mentioned trying to wind down earlier. What does that look like currently?  

Priya: I usually start shutting down my devices around 10:45 PM, then do some light stretching or listen to calming music. But sometimes, my mind still races, especially when I think about upcoming reports or meetings.  

[01:40]  
Dr. Torres: That’s quite common in high-achievers. Incorporating a brief mindfulness or journaling practice might help clear your mind. Have you tried writing down your worries before bed?  

Priya: I haven’t really done that consistently, but I do have a habit of jotting down to-do lists. Maybe I can add a section for worries or thoughts that come up.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a great idea. Externalizing those thoughts can reduce their grip on your mind. Also, using a dedicated worry journal can help you process them earlier in the evening, rather than right before sleep.  

Priya: I like that. I’ll try it tonight.  

[01:50]  
Dr. Torres: Good. And as part of our ongoing work, I want us to consider some sleep restriction therapy. Since you’re already waking up around 3 AM, we can look at adjusting your sleep window gradually to improve sleep efficiency. Would you be comfortable with that?  

Priya: Yeah, I think that makes sense. I’d rather have more consolidated sleep.  

Dr. Torres: Great. We’ll plan a gradual adjustment next week, but for now, focus on maintaining your current routine, practicing stimulus control, and using the cognitive reframing we discussed.  

Priya: Sounds good. I feel like I have some tangible steps now, which is helpful.  

Dr. Torres: Wonderful. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling emotionally today? Any particular concerns or feelings you want to mention?  

Priya: Honestly, I do feel a bit more hopeful. It’s been frustrating, but I see that small changes are adding up. I just need to be patient with myself.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a very healthy outlook. Progress in sleep and stress management is often gradual. Remember to celebrate these small wins. For next week, try implementing the worry journaling and continue your stimulus control practices. We’ll also revisit sleep restriction once you’re comfortable.  

Priya: Thank you, Dr. Torres. I appreciate your support and guidance.  

Dr. Torres: You’re very welcome, Priya. I’ll see you next week, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before then. Have a good rest of your day.  

Priya: Thanks, you too.
