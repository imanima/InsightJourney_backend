Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

01:00 [Start of Session]  
Dr. Torres: Hi Priya, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Priya: Hi, Dr. Torres. Overall, I think I’ve been a little better, but sleep is still a huge issue. I’d say I’m pretty exhausted most mornings.  

01:05  
Dr. Torres: I hear you. It’s good that you’re noticing some changes, but clearly sleep remains a challenge. Last time, we discussed some sleep hygiene practices—how have you been implementing those?  
Priya: I’ve tried to stick with a consistent bedtime, around 11:30 PM, and I’ve been limiting screen time an hour before bed. Sometimes I still end up scrolling, though.  

01:10  
Dr. Torres: That’s good progress. The fact that you’re aware of your screen time is already a positive step. You mentioned scrolling sometimes; what usually triggers that?  
Priya: Honestly, I think I get anxious about tomorrow’s meetings, and I just want to distract myself. It’s like I can’t quiet my mind.  

01:15  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common experience, especially for high-achievers like yourself. We can explore some mindfulness techniques or cognitive strategies to help ease that racing mind. Have you tried any relaxation exercises before bed?  
Priya: I’ve done some breathing exercises a few times, but I don’t think I’ve been consistent. They do help when I remember to do them.  

01:20  
Dr. Torres: Consistency is key, so let’s set a small goal for that. But before we do, I want to revisit the sleep restriction idea we discussed last time—limiting time in bed to match your actual sleep time. How has that been going?  
Priya: Honestly, I haven’t really tried it seriously. I’m worried that if I go to bed later or get up earlier, I’ll just feel even more tired during the day.  

01:25  
Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. Sleep restriction can feel counterintuitive at first, but it often helps consolidate sleep and improve quality. Would you be willing to try a gentle version—like adjusting your bedtime by 15 minutes every few nights based on how you sleep?  
Priya: Maybe. I’m willing to give it a shot, but I’m skeptical. I’ve tried so many things, and nothing has really stuck.  

01:30  
Dr. Torres: That’s a valid concern, and it’s common in the beginning. Remember, this is a gradual process. We’ll track your sleep patterns and make adjustments together. Speaking of which, how’s your sleep tracking app been working?  
Priya: It’s fine. I’ve been noting my bedtime, wake-up time, and how rested I feel in the mornings. Sometimes I get anxious about the data, though—like I get obsessed with the numbers.  

01:35  
Dr. Torres: That’s interesting. Data can be helpful, but it can also increase anxiety if we become too fixated on it. Let’s work on some cognitive restructuring around your thoughts about sleep. When you see a bad night recorded, what do you tell yourself?  
Priya: I think, "I’m never going to fix this," or "I’m doomed to be tired forever." It makes me feel worse.  

01:40  
Dr. Torres: Those are very harsh thoughts. Let’s try to reframe them. What’s a more balanced way to view occasional poor sleep?  
Priya: Maybe I could tell myself, “One bad night doesn’t mean I’ll never sleep well again. I can improve gradually.”  

01:45  
Dr. Torres: Exactly. Cognitive restructuring involves challenging those all-or-nothing thoughts. How does that feel to you?  
Priya: It feels a bit better, but I still get caught up in the worst-case scenario. I guess I just want to get this right.  

01:50  
Dr. Torres: That’s a common perfectionist tendency. Remember, progress isn’t linear, and setbacks are part of the process. Let’s also incorporate some mindfulness exercises to help manage these anxious thoughts during the day. Have you tried a brief mindfulness practice before?  
Priya: Not really regularly. I’ve downloaded some apps, but I get distracted easily.  

01:55  
Dr. Torres: That’s okay. We can start with short, 3-minute exercises. For example, focusing on your breath or noticing sensations in your body. Would you be willing to try one now?  
Priya: Sure, I can try.  

02:00  
(They do a brief guided breathing exercise.)  

02:05  
Dr. Torres: How do you feel after that?  
Priya: Slightly calmer, actually. I think I forget how helpful just a few minutes can be.  

02:10  
Dr. Torres: That’s great. Incorporating these into your daily routine, especially before bed or during stressful moments, can really help. Looking ahead, what’s one small change you feel ready to commit to before our next session?  
Priya: I think I’ll stick with the mindfulness practice and try to be consistent with my sleep window adjustments.  

02:15  
Dr. Torres: Excellent. And remember, I’m here to support you through each step. We’ll review your progress next time and tweak strategies as needed. Anything else you want to discuss today?  
Priya: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

02:20  
Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Priya. Great work today. See you next week, and take care.
