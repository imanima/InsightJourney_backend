Session 11/24
Date: July 13, 2025
Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

[03:02] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks, I’ve been okay. Slightly better with some days, but still dealing with that persistent lower back pain, especially after long work hours. (sighs) It’s been a bit frustrating.

[03:05] Mara: I hear you. It’s common for the pattern to fluctuate, especially with stress and prolonged sitting. Did you notice any particular triggers or moments when the pain intensifies?

[03:07] Mei: Yeah, mostly at the end of busy days when I’ve been at my desk for hours. I also noticed that when I get stressed about deadlines, the pain feels sharper, like it’s more than just physical discomfort.

[03:10] Mara: That’s an important observation. The connection between stress and physical pain is quite profound. It’s like your body and mind are communicating through these sensations. Have you been tracking any pain patterns or journaling about these episodes?

[03:12] Mei: I’ve been trying to note it in my digital journal, especially when I notice the pain worsening. I’ve also been paying attention to my posture, especially with that ergonomic setup we talked about last time.

[03:15] Mara: Excellent. That awareness is a strong foundation. Let’s do a quick body scan now, to check in with how your body is holding tension today. Find a comfortable seated position, and just take a few deep breaths with me.

[03:17] (Mei follows the breathing, Mara guides her through a brief body scan, focusing on areas of tension)

[03:20] Mara: How does your body feel right now? Any particular areas of tightness or discomfort?

[03:22] Mei: My lower back is a bit tense, especially on the right side. I also feel some tightness in my shoulders, probably from leaning forward at my desk.

[03:25] Mara: Noticing that tension is key. When you think about your back, can you identify where the sensation is strongest? Is it a dull ache, a sharp pain, or something else?

[03:27] Mei: It’s more of a dull ache, but sometimes it sharpens when I stretch or move suddenly.

[03:30] Mara: That’s useful information. Often, pain that fluctuates like that can be related to muscle holding patterns and stress. Have you noticed any specific movements or positions that seem to worsen or relieve the pain?

[03:32] Mei: Sitting for long periods definitely makes it worse. But I’ve found that gentle stretches or standing up helps a bit. Also, I notice that when I consciously breathe into my back, the pain eases temporarily.

[03:35] Mara: Breathing into the area can be very effective. It helps to send calming signals and can release some of the tension held there. Let’s try a breathing exercise now—inhale deeply into your belly, imagining your breath reaching your lower back, and exhale slowly.

[03:37] (Mei follows the breath, visibly relaxing)

[03:40] Mara: Good. As you breathe, notice if any sensations or feelings come up—perhaps a sense of openness or resistance.

[03:42] Mei: I do feel a bit more relaxed, but there's still that underlying dull ache. Sometimes I feel like my body is holding onto stress in that area.

[03:45] Mara: That’s very insightful. Our bodies often hold onto stress as tension, which can manifest as pain. Over time, with consistent awareness and movement, we can start to release that. Do you recall the movement or posture habits from last time that seemed to help?

[03:48] Mei: Yes, I tried to incorporate some of the micro-movements we discussed, like gentle spinal rotations and shoulder rolls during the day. I also adjusted my chair height slightly.

[03:50] Mara: That’s great progress. Small, regular movements can prevent tension from building up too much. How has that been working for you overall?

[03:53] Mei: It’s helped a little, but I still find it hard to stick to a routine, especially during busy days. Sometimes I forget or get too caught up.

[03:55] Mara: That’s understandable. Building new habits takes time and consistency. Maybe we can set some gentle intentions for the coming week—like a 2-minute movement break every hour or mindful breathing sessions at certain points in your day.

[03:57] Mei: I think I can do that. It sounds manageable.

[04:00] Mara: Excellent. Also, I want to revisit some of your pain journaling. When you record your experiences, notice the circumstances—like posture, stress levels, or activities—that coincide with pain spikes. This pattern recognition can guide us further.

[04:03] Mei: That makes sense. I’ve noticed that on days when I’m more stressed or have tight deadlines, the pain is worse in the evening.

[04:05] Mara: Stress management is a key part of pain reduction. Let’s explore a simple somatic technique called "resourcing"—finding internal or external cues that make you feel safe or grounded. Do you have any images, memories, or sensations that help you feel calm?

[04:07] Mei: I often think of a peaceful lake I visited last year, the quiet and stillness there.

[04:09] Mara: Beautiful. Whenever stress or pain intensifies, you can gently bring that image to mind, allowing it to anchor you in calmness. Let’s try a quick visualization now.

[04:11] (Mei closes her eyes briefly, Mara guides her through a visualization of the lake, emphasizing breath and sensation)

[04:14] Mei: I do feel more centered already. It’s like I can breathe into that calmness.

[04:16] Mara: That’s wonderful. Using these internal resources can support both your body awareness and emotional resilience. Moving forward, integrating these practices into your daily routine will be beneficial.

[04:19] Mei: I like that idea. Sometimes I forget to pause, but having a quick visualization could really help.

[04:21] Mara: Absolutely. Remember, consistency is more important than intensity. Small, regular practices will accumulate over time. As we continue, we can also explore more movement-based tools tailored to your workday.

[04:24] Mei: That sounds good. I really want to find sustainable ways to manage my pain and stress.

[04:26] Mara: And you’re making excellent progress already. Before we wrap up today, let’s set some clear action items. First, continue your pain journaling and note any patterns. Second, try to incorporate a movement or breathing break every hour. And third, whenever you feel tension building, bring that calming lake imagery to mind.

[04:29] Mei: Got it. I’ll do that. Thank you, Mara. I feel more hopeful and equipped to handle my day now.

[04:31] Mara: I’m glad to hear that, Mei. Remember, progress is a journey, and you’re doing really well. For next week, we’ll check in on how these practices are working and refine them as needed.

[04:33] Mei: Looking forward to it. Thanks again.

[04:35] Mara: You're welcome. Take care, Mei, and see you next week.
