**[03:00]** Mara: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Mei: Hi Mara, thanks. I’ve been okay, I think. My back’s been a bit better, but I still notice some tension building up during the day, especially around my shoulders.  
Mara: That’s good to hear there’s some improvement. When you say tension builds up, do you notice it more during specific tasks or times of the day?  

**[03:10]** Mei: Yeah, mostly when I’m in meetings or working on my laptop for long stretches. I catch myself leaning forward or tightening my shoulders without realizing it.  
Mara: That’s quite common with desk work. Have you been able to catch those moments and maybe pause or adjust?  
Mei: Sometimes, but I get so focused that I forget to check in with my body. I also notice my lower back is sore by the end of the day.  

Mara: That’s a good observation. The body often signals us when something’s off. Today, I’d like us to explore those patterns more deeply through body scanning and breath work. Would that be okay?  

**[03:20]** Mei: Yes, I’d like that. I think I need to reconnect with what my body’s telling me.  
Mara: Great. Let’s start with a quick body scan. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you feel safe doing so, and take a few deep breaths. (pauses) Start by bringing awareness to your feet—what sensations do you feel?  

Mei: I… I notice some warmth and a slight tingling in my toes.  
Mara: Good. Slowly move your attention up to your ankles and calves—what do you notice there?  
Mei: My calves feel a bit tight, especially on the right side. Like I’ve been holding something in.  

Mara: Noticing that tension is important. Now, bring awareness to your lower back—what do you feel there?  
Mei: Hmm, I think I’m holding some tightness, especially on the left side near my lumbar area.  

Mara: Excellent observation. When you notice this tension, can you gently breathe into those areas?  
Mei: I can try. (inhales slowly) It’s like I can send my breath right into the tight spots.  

**[03:30]** Mara: That’s perfect. Breathing into areas of tension helps release it gradually. Now, think about a recent moment when your pain or tension increased. Can you recall what was happening just before?  
Mei: Let me see… I was in a meeting, sitting very still, and I remember feeling my shoulders creeping up. I think I was trying to focus but my body was tightening without me noticing.  

Mara: That’s insightful. Often, stress manifests physically when we’re not aware of it. Now, let’s explore that connection between your stress and pain. How does your body react when you feel stressed at work?  
Mei: I tend to clench my jaw, and my shoulders get stiff. Sometimes I hold my breath without realizing it.  

Mara: That’s a common stress response. Let’s incorporate some gentle breath work to help you regulate that. I’ll guide you through a simple breathing exercise. Breathe in deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale slowly for a count of six. Ready?  
Mei: Yes, I’m ready.  

**[03:40]** Mara: Inhale… (pause) and exhale… (pause) Nice. Let’s do a few more rounds. As you breathe, notice if the tension in your body begins to soften.  
Mei: I already feel a bit more relaxed. My shoulders are easing down.  

Mara: That’s wonderful. This kind of breath work can be a quick tool during your busy day to reset. Now, thinking about your work setup—have you made any ergonomic adjustments since our last session?  
Mei: Yes, I rearranged my desk, raised my monitor to eye level, and added a lumbar support pillow. It feels better, but sometimes I forget to sit upright.  

Mara: That’s normal. Building awareness is key. Let’s do a quick movement practice now to integrate some gentle movement into your routine. I’ll guide you through a seated spine twist and shoulder rolls. (demonstrates movements) Would you like to try?  
Mei: Yes, I’d like that.  

**[03:50]** (Mei follows movement instructions, gently twisting and rolling shoulders)  
Mara: Excellent. Notice how these movements feel—do they help release any tension?  
Mei: Yes, especially the shoulder rolls. It’s like I can free some of that stiffness I hold during the day.  

Mara: Good. Incorporating these brief movements regularly can make a significant difference. Before we finish today, I want us to set a small goal. What’s one thing you feel ready to try before our next session?  
Mei: I think I can start doing these breathing exercises during meetings when I notice my shoulders tensing up.  

Mara: That’s a great step. Keep a small journal of when you practice and how you notice your body responding. We’ll review your progress next time. How does that sound?  
Mei: Perfect. I’ll do that. Thanks, Mara.  

**[04:00]** Mara: You’re very welcome. Remember, body awareness is a gradual process—be patient and kind with yourself. I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions or anything else you’d like to share today?  
Mei: Not right now, but I do feel more connected to what my body’s telling me. That’s a good start.  

Mara: I’m glad to hear that. We’re making steady progress. See you next week, Mei.  
Mei: Thanks, Mara. Have a good day.
