[15:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or moments you want to share?

[15:02] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. Actually, I’ve been noticing a bit more awareness around my posture during the day. I caught myself sitting straighter without even thinking about it. But the back pain still fluctuates — some days are better, others worse.

[15:04] Mara: That’s a great sign—your body is starting to respond differently. When you notice the pain fluctuating, do you also notice any patterns? Like, specific activities or times of day that seem to influence it?

[15:07] Mei: Well, I think mornings are better, but after long meetings or working on my laptop, it tends to tighten up. I also realize I hold my breath sometimes when I get stressed, which probably doesn’t help.

[15:09] Mara: That’s insightful. Holding your breath can increase tension and even reinforce pain patterns. Let’s try a quick body scan now—focusing on your breath and noticing where you feel tension. Would that work?

[15:11] Mei: Sure, I’d like that.

[15:12] Mara: Great. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose… (pauses) and exhale gently through your mouth. Focus on your shoulders and back. Notice any sensations—tightness, warmth, or maybe a dull ache.

[15:15] Mei: (pause, breaths slowly) I feel a tightness across my upper back, especially near my shoulder blades. It’s like a constant low-grade ache.

[15:17] Mara: Noticing that is a step toward understanding your pain. When you observe this tension, does it feel like it’s connected to your work stress or posture habits?

[15:19] Mei: Yeah, I think so. When I’m deep into a problem or feeling overwhelmed, I tend to hunch forward more, which probably worsens it.

[15:21] Mara: That makes sense. Your body often reflects your emotional state. Let’s explore how your breathing pattern might be contributing. Would you like to try a simple breath adjustment now—like a gentle belly breath—to see if it shifts your tension?

[15:24] Mei: Yes, I’d like to try that.

[15:25] Mara: Good. Place your hand lightly on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise… and exhale softly through your mouth, noticing your belly fall. Let’s do this for a few breaths. (pause) How does that feel?

[15:28] Mei: It feels a bit more relaxed, actually. My shoulders seem to drop slightly.

[15:30] Mara: Excellent. That’s a sign that breath awareness can influence tension. Over time, integrating this into your daily routine could help manage your pain and stress levels.

[15:32] Mei: That sounds promising. I’ve never really paid attention to my breathing like that.

[15:34] Mara: Many people don’t until they experience the calming effect firsthand. Now, considering your work setup, do you recall our previous discussion about ergonomic adjustments? Have you made any changes or noticed any improvements?

[15:36] Mei: Yes, I adjusted my chair height and added a lumbar support. I also set reminders to take brief movement breaks. It’s helped a bit, but sometimes I forget or get absorbed in tasks.

[15:39] Mara: That’s quite common. Building those pauses into your workflow is key. How about incorporating some gentle movement or stretching during those breaks? Would you be open to a simple sequence?

[15:42] Mei: Definitely. I want to find ways to stay more comfortable during the day.

[15:44] Mara: Great. Let’s do a quick movement sequence now—focused on releasing tension in your back and shoulders. (demonstrates gentle neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, and spinal twists) Would you like to guide yourself through this with me?

[15:47] Mei: Yes, I’ll follow.

[15:48] Mara: Good. Slowly roll your shoulders up and back… and then release. Feel free to pause if anything feels uncomfortable. Next, gentle neck tilts—ear toward shoulder, hold briefly, then switch sides. And finally, seated spinal twists—turn your torso gently to one side, hold briefly, then switch. How does that feel?

[15:52] Mei: It feels good, actually. I notice my back and shoulders already feeling a bit looser.

[15:54] Mara: That’s exactly what we’re aiming for. Small, consistent movements like these can accumulate into significant relief over time. Do you think adding these into your daily routine could fit your schedule?

[15:57] Mei: Yes, I believe I can set reminders for every couple of hours.

[15:59] Mara: Perfect. Now, reflecting on our work over the past sessions, have you noticed any shifts in how you perceive or manage your pain?

[16:01] Mei: I think I’m becoming more aware of the connection between my stress, posture, and pain. I feel more in control, even if the pain isn’t gone completely yet.

[16:04] Mara: That’s a meaningful change. Awareness is often the first step toward sustainable change. As we continue, we’ll focus on integrating movement into your daily life and exploring emotional factors that might influence tension.

[16:07] Mei: I appreciate that. It feels good to have some tools and a better understanding.

[16:09] Mara: Absolutely. Before we wrap up, let’s set a couple of specific goals for the next week. What feels most manageable to you?

[16:11] Mei: I’d like to practice the breathing exercises daily and do the movement routine during my work breaks. Also, I’ll keep a brief pain journal to track fluctuations.

[16:14] Mara: Excellent. That will give us valuable insights. And next time, we can review your journal and explore any patterns or insights you notice.

[16:16] Mei: Sounds good. Thank you, Mara.

[16:17] Mara: You’re welcome, Mei. Keep gentle awareness at the forefront, and remember, progress takes small steps. See you next week.

[16:19] Mei: Looking forward to it. Bye!

[16:20] Mara: Bye!
