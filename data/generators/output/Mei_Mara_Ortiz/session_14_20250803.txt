[15:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[15:02] Mei: Hi Mara. Honestly, I’ve had some ups and downs. The pain has been a bit more manageable at times, but there are days when it feels worse, especially after long meetings or when I’m really stressed at work.

[15:04] Mara: That’s understandable, especially considering the workload and stress you’re balancing. Let’s start with a quick body scan today. Are you comfortable to do that now?

[15:05] Mei: Yes, I am. (sits back, relaxed but attentive)

[15:05] Mara: Great. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. Focus on your feet—notice any sensations or tension there.

[15:07] Mei: Okay. I feel some tightness in my toes, and my heels feel a bit numb, like I’m not fully aware of my contact with the ground.

[15:08] Mara: Good observation. Now, move your attention up through your legs—notice your calves, knees, thighs. Do you notice any particular tension or discomfort?

[15:09] Mei: My lower back is kind of tight, especially on the right side, and my shoulders feel tense, probably from sitting so much.

[15:10] Mara: That’s very insightful. As you breathe into your body, see if you can send some gentle awareness to that tightness. Breathing into those areas can sometimes help release tension.

[15:12] Mei: (takes a deep breath) I can feel the tightness loosening a little. It’s like I’m giving it space to soften.

[15:13] Mara: Excellent. How about your chest and neck? Any sensations there?

[15:14] Mei: My neck feels stiff, and my chest is a bit tight, probably from holding my breath during stressful meetings.

[15:15] Mara: That’s a common response to stress—holding tension in those areas. Now, I’d like to ask you—when you notice this tension, what do you think might be triggering it? Is it work-related, or are there other factors?

[15:16] Mei: Mostly work. The constant deadlines and back-to-back meetings make me tense, especially when I feel I’m not making enough progress.

[15:18] Mara: That connection makes sense. Stress can manifest physically, especially when our bodies are in a kind of fight-or-flight mode. Have you noticed any patterns in your pain or tension during specific times or tasks?

[15:20] Mei: Yes. My back pain tends to spike after long stretches of sitting without breaks, especially when I’m deep in focus or feeling overwhelmed.

[15:21] Mara: That’s valuable insight. It suggests that integrating movement or breaks could help. Have you been able to incorporate any movement during your workday recently?

[15:22] Mei: Not consistently. I try to stretch every hour, but sometimes I forget or get too busy.

[15:23] Mara: That’s common. Let’s explore some simple movement techniques you can do at your desk or in your space, even for just a few minutes. Would you be open to that?

[15:24] Mei: Definitely. I want to find ways to manage this better.

[15:25] Mara: Perfect. Before we get into movement, I want to check in on your pain journaling. Have you been tracking your pain levels and triggers as we discussed?

[15:26] Mei: Yes, I’ve been noting it daily. I also added some notes about what I was doing before the pain worsened.

[15:27] Mara: That’s excellent. Any patterns emerging from your notes?

[15:28] Mei: Yes. I noticed that the pain tends to be worse after particularly stressful meetings or when I skip breaks. Also, I realized that my posture during those times is often poor—slouching or leaning forward.

[15:30] Mara: That’s very helpful. It confirms the link between your stress, posture, and pain. Improving your ergonomic setup and posture awareness could make a difference. Have you made any adjustments to your workspace since our last session?

[15:32] Mei: I did. I raised my monitor, got a better chair, and set reminders to sit upright. But I sometimes slip back into old habits when I get busy.

[15:34] Mara: That’s normal. The key is gentle awareness and patience. Now, I’d like to guide you through a brief movement sequence tailored to release tension and reset your posture. Are you ready?

[15:36] Mei: Yes, I am.

[15:36] Mara: Great. Sit comfortably with your feet flat on the ground. Take a deep inhale, and as you exhale, gently roll your shoulders back and down, opening your chest. (pause) Now, inhale again and reach your arms overhead, stretching through your fingertips. Hold for a few seconds, then exhale and lower your arms slowly. Repeat this twice.

[15:38] Mei: (follows the movement) It feels good to stretch out my shoulders and arms. I notice my back feels a bit more open.

[15:40] Mara: Perfect. Incorporate this kind of movement into your day, especially during those long periods of sitting. It can help release tension and improve circulation. How does your back feel now after that?

[15:41] Mei: Slightly better. I think just a few minutes of movement makes a difference.

[15:42] Mara: Absolutely. Small, frequent movements are powerful. Also, consider setting a timer or using your wearable to remind you to take these micro-breaks.

[15:43] Mei: That’s a good idea. Sometimes I get so caught up that I forget to move.

[15:44] Mara: Now, let’s revisit your breath. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can help manage stress and reduce pain. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Breathe in deeply through your nose, feeling your belly expand. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Would you like to try?

[15:45] Mei: Sure. (takes a breath) I can feel my belly rise and fall. It’s calming.

[15:47] Mara: Excellent. Practice this breathing regularly, especially during stressful moments. It can help shift your nervous system from tension to relaxation.

[15:48] Mei: I’ll start doing that more intentionally.

[15:50] Mara: Great. To wrap up, let’s briefly check in on how you’re feeling overall—physically and emotionally—after this session.

[15:51] Mei: I feel more aware of my body and stress signals. The movement and breathing exercises help me feel a bit more grounded. The pain is still there, but I feel more equipped to manage it.

[15:52] Mara: That’s wonderful progress. Remember, integrating these practices into your daily routine can gradually improve your comfort and stress levels. For next time, keep tracking your pain and triggers, and try the movement and breathing techniques we discussed today.

[15:54] Mei: Will do. Thank you, Mara. This feels like a good step forward.

[15:55] Mara: You’re very welcome, Mei. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care until then.

[15:56] Mei: Thanks again. Have a good day.

[15:57] Mara: You too. Goodbye.
