Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How has your week been? Any notable changes or experiences since our last session?

[03:02] Mei: Hi Mara. It’s good to see you too. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve noticed my back pain flaring up a little more during long workdays, especially when I’m deep into meetings. But I’ve also been trying to pay more attention to my breathing, so that’s a positive. (smiles softly)

[03:05] Mara: That’s great to hear you’re experimenting with your breath. It’s a powerful tool. When your pain increases during those long meetings, do you notice anything specific happening in your body or mind at that time?

[03:07] Mei: Yeah, I tend to feel my shoulders tightening and my chest feels a bit constricted. Sometimes I realize I’m holding my breath or just not breathing deeply enough, especially when I get distracted or stressed.

[03:10] Mara: That’s a common pattern, especially with stress leading to shallow breathing and muscle tension. Let’s try something now—take a moment to settle in. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and just notice your breath without changing it. How does it feel right now?

[03:12] Mei: (closes eyes briefly) It feels a bit shallow, actually. Like I’m not really fully breathing in or out.

[03:14] Mara: Noticing that is already a good step. Now, let’s do a simple breath awareness exercise. Breathe in slowly through your nose for a count of four, and then exhale through your mouth for a count of six. We’ll do that together a few times. (pauses) Ready?

[03:16] Mei: Yes, I’m ready.

[03:17] Mara: Inhale... 1, 2, 3, 4. Exhale... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Good. Let’s do one more. Inhale... and exhale... (guides her through a few rounds) How do you feel now?

[03:20] Mei: Slightly more relaxed. It’s interesting how just focusing on my breath makes a difference.

[03:22] Mara: Absolutely. Breathing consciously can help reset the nervous system and reduce muscle tension. Now, I’d like to revisit your pain journal from last week. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers you want to share?

[03:25] Mei: Yes, I recorded that my pain is often worse after sitting for more than an hour, especially if I don’t take breaks. I also noticed that when I’m feeling overwhelmed at work, my back tightens up more.

[03:27] Mara: That’s valuable insight. It shows how your emotional state and work habits influence physical pain. Have you been able to incorporate any movement or breaks during your workday?

[03:29] Mei: I’ve tried setting a timer to stand up and stretch every 45 minutes, but honestly, I sometimes forget or get caught up in tasks.

[03:31] Mara: That’s understandable. Consistency takes time. Let’s explore some gentle movement strategies you can embed into your work routine. Would you be open to trying some simple seated movements or stretches now?

[03:33] Mei: Yes, I’d like that.

[03:34] Mara: Great. Let’s start with a simple seated twist. Sit upright and place your right hand on your left knee. As you inhale, lengthen your spine. As you exhale, gently twist toward the left, looking over your shoulder. Hold for a breath or two, then switch sides. (demonstrates) How does that feel?

[03:37] Mei: (follows along) It feels good, a gentle stretch. I can see how it might help break up the tension.

[03:39] Mara: Exactly. Even just a minute of these movements every hour can help reduce stiffness and promote circulation. Now, thinking ahead, I’d like us to explore how your body responds to stress more generally. Have you noticed any particular patterns or sensations when you’re feeling overwhelmed?

[03:41] Mei: I definitely feel my jaw clenching, and I sometimes get a tightness in my chest. My shoulders also creep up towards my ears.

[03:43] Mara: Those are common stress responses. Let’s do a quick body scan now. Close your eyes again if you’re comfortable. Start by bringing awareness to your feet, then slowly move your attention upward—legs, hips, torso, arms, neck, and face. Notice any areas of tension or tightness.

(quiet pause as Mei does the body scan)

[03:50] Mara: What did you notice?

[03:52] Mei: I felt a lot of tightness in my shoulders and jaw. My chest feels a bit heavy too.

[03:55] Mara: Noticing these sensations is a great step. Now, let’s do some gentle body-oriented breath work. As you breathe in, imagine sending your breath to those tight areas, and as you exhale, imagine releasing some of that tension. Would you like to try that now?

[03:57] Mei: Yes, I’d like to.

[03:58] Mara: Inhale, sending breath to your shoulders and jaw. Exhale, consciously soften those areas. (guides her through a few cycles) How does that feel?

[04:03] Mei: It feels a bit more spacious, like I’m giving those areas permission to relax.

[04:05] Mara: That’s wonderful. Remember, these techniques are tools you can use anytime during your day to help manage stress and pain.

[04:07] Mei: I appreciate that. I think I tend to ignore how much tension I carry until it becomes painful.

[04:09] Mara: That’s common. Part of our work is developing awareness so you can catch those signs early. Over the next few weeks, I’d like you to continue tracking your pain and stress levels, and try integrating some of these movement and breath practices into your routine. How does that sound?

[04:12] Mei: Sounds good. I’m committed to trying these consistently.

[04:14] Mara: Excellent. Before we finish today, I want to acknowledge the progress you’ve already made—recognizing the triggers and beginning to implement small changes. That’s a big step in body-mind work. Are there any questions or concerns before we wrap up?

[04:16] Mei: Not right now. I feel more aware and equipped to handle my back pain better. Thank you, Mara.

[04:18] Mara: You’re very welcome. Our next session, we’ll explore more movement strategies and deepen your body awareness. For now, keep gentle attention on your breath and incorporate those stretches. See you next week.

[04:20] Mei: Looking forward to it. Thanks again.

[04:22] Mara: Take care, Mei. Have a peaceful week.
