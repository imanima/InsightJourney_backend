Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Any notable changes or patterns you've noticed?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. I’ve been mostly okay, I think. I’ve still got that persistent lower back tension after long days at my desk, but I’ve started paying more attention to my breath and body during work. It feels a bit better, honestly.

[03:10] Mara: That’s great to hear you’re experimenting with breath work. Sometimes small shifts can make a big difference. Have you noticed any particular times during the day when the pain intensifies or eases?

[03:15] Mei: Yeah, definitely. Usually mid-afternoon, around 2:30 or 3:00, I start feeling more tension, especially if I’ve been sitting in the same position for a while. It’s like this dull ache that kind of creeps up my lower back.

[03:20] Mara: That’s a common pattern with desk work, especially if posture isn’t constantly supported. Do you recall from our previous sessions if there’s a specific movement or position that triggers it?

[03:25] Mei: I think it’s mostly when I’m leaning forward slightly to look at my screen, or if I forget to check my ergonomic setup. My chair height and monitor position are decent, but I notice I tend to slouch or lean in without realizing.

[03:30] Mara: Awareness is already a big step. Let’s do a quick body scan now—close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and just bring your attention to your body, starting from your head down to your feet. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort.

(Mae closes her eyes, takes a deep breath)

[03:35] Mei: (pauses, then speaks softly) Okay. I notice my shoulders are tight, especially on the right side. My lower back feels a bit achy, and my hips feel a little stiff.

[03:40] Mara: Good observation. Those areas are often interconnected, especially if you’re sitting for long periods. Can you notice if your breath feels shallow in those tense areas or if there's any restriction?

[03:45] Mei: Yes, I think I tend to hold my breath a bit when I feel stressed or uncomfortable, especially in my shoulders and back.

[03:50] Mara: That’s quite common. Let’s do a gentle breath awareness exercise. Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your belly and ribs, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Focus on softening your shoulders and relaxing your back with each exhale. Would you like to try that now?

(Mae nods, begins breathing slowly)

[03:55] Mei: (breathing) That feels good. I already notice my shoulders are loosening a little.

[04:00] Mara: Excellent. This kind of breath can help release tension in your body. Now, thinking about your work routine—are there specific movements or postures you could incorporate to break up the sitting time and prevent this tension from building?

[04:05] Mei: I’ve been meaning to set alarms to remind me to stand or stretch, but honestly, I get so caught up in my tasks that I forget. I know I should be more disciplined about it.

[04:10] Mara: It’s understandable. Sometimes, integrating movement into your work can be more effective if it’s accessible and easy to remember. What if you scheduled short movement breaks every 30 minutes, even just for 1-2 minutes? Something simple like shoulder rolls, gentle spinal twists, or even standing at your desk.

[04:15] Mei: That makes sense. I think I can set a reminder on my phone. I like the idea of simple movements—I want to avoid complicated routines that I might abandon after a week.

[04:20] Mara: Exactly. Consistency is key, and small, manageable actions create lasting change. How about we explore a quick movement sequence you can do at your desk now? Something that addresses your back and hips.

(Mae nods)

[04:25] Mara: Let’s start with a seated cat-cow stretch. Sit upright, inhale as you arch your back, lifting your chest and chin slightly—like a gentle cow pose. Exhale as you round your back, tucking your chin toward your chest—like a seated cat. Do that a few times, paying attention to your breath and how your spine moves.

(Mae follows the movement)

[04:30] Mei: (smiles slightly) That feels good. It’s like giving my spine a little wake-up.

[04:35] Mara: Great. Incorporating this into your routine can help reduce stiffness and improve awareness of your posture. Now, thinking about your pain journal—have you been tracking your pain levels and triggers consistently?

[04:40] Mei: Yes, I’ve been noting how I feel at different times, what I was doing, and how my posture was. It’s been helpful to identify patterns, especially that mid-afternoon spike.

[04:45] Mara: That’s excellent. Recognizing these patterns gives us clues on how to tailor your movement and breathing techniques even better. Over the next couple of weeks, I’d like you to continue this tracking and also note any new strategies you try.

[04:50] Mei: Will do. I think I’m starting to connect the dots between stress, posture, and pain more clearly.

[04:55] Mara: That’s a significant insight. Remember, body awareness is a process—each session builds on the last. As we progress, we’ll explore more movement strategies and perhaps some gentle somatic exercises to deepen your body-mind connection.

[05:00] Mei: I’m looking forward to it. Thanks, Mara. I feel a bit more empowered already, knowing I can do small things to help manage the pain.

[05:05] Mara: I’m glad to hear that, Mei. Before we wrap up, let’s set a couple of action items: continue your pain journal, set reminders for movement breaks, and practice the breathing and seated stretch daily. Does that sound manageable?

[05:10] Mei: Yes, absolutely. Thanks so much, Mara. See you next week.

[05:15] Mara: You’re welcome, Mei. Take care and listen to your body. See you next week.
