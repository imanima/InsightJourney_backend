Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or moments you'd like to share?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. I’ve been better, honestly. I’ve noticed my back pain fluctuates more during the week, especially after long meetings or intense workdays. Sometimes I feel tension building up in my shoulders and lower back, and it’s frustrating because I can’t always pinpoint what’s triggering it.

[03:10] Mara: That’s a common experience, and it’s good you’re paying attention to those patterns. Have you been practicing the body scans or breath work we discussed last time? How did that go?

[03:15] Mei: I did try the body scan a few times, mostly in the evening. It helps me become more aware of where I hold tension, but I struggle to stay focused sometimes because my mind jumps around, especially when I’m stressed about deadlines.

[03:20] Mara: That’s perfectly normal. The mind is naturally restless, especially under stress. The key is gentle patience. When your attention wanders, just gently bring it back to the body without judgment. Have you noticed any particular areas where the tension feels most persistent?

[03:25] Mei: Yeah, mostly in my lower back and my neck. When I sit at my desk, I think I tend to slouch or lean forward without realizing it. I also notice that my shoulders get stiff after a few hours.

[03:30] Mara: That’s insightful. It sounds like your posture during work might be contributing. Have you been able to adjust your workspace setup or incorporate short movement breaks?

[03:35] Mei: I’ve started using my ergonomic chair more, and I set reminders to stand or stretch every 30 minutes. But sometimes I get caught up in tasks and forget to move.

[03:40] Mara: That’s a good start. Small, consistent movements can really help. Today, I’d like us to explore some gentle movement sequences that you can integrate seamlessly into your work routine, even during busy days. Would that be okay?

[03:45] Mei: Yes, definitely. I think that could help me feel more in control of the pain and stress.

[03:50] Mara: Excellent. Before we dive into movement, let’s do a quick body scan to reconnect. Close your eyes if that feels comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. Focus on sensation—what do you notice in your body right now?

(Mei closes her eyes briefly, breathing slowly)

[03:55] Mei: I feel some tightness in my lower back and a bit of tension in my shoulders. My neck feels a little strained too.

[03:55] Mara: Noticing that is a great first step. As you breathe in, imagine drawing awareness into those areas. When you exhale, see if you can soften the tension just a little. Would you like to try a breath technique I call “sighing out tension”?

[04:00] Mei: Sure, I’d like that.

[Mara guides Mei through a brief breathing exercise, emphasizing slow inhales and audible exhales]

[04:05] Mara: How do you feel after that?

[04:05] Mei: Actually, I feel a bit more relaxed. The tension in my shoulders is less noticeable.

[04:10] Mara: That’s wonderful. Now, let’s move into some gentle movements you can do at your desk. I’ll guide you through a seated cat-cow stretch. Sit tall, inhale as you arch your back slightly, lifting your chest and looking up. Exhale as you round your spine, tucking your chin toward your chest. Let’s do that a few times.

(Mei follows the movement, her breathing synchronized with the motion)

[04:15] Mei: I can feel my spine loosening up a little. It’s a nice break from sitting still.

[04:20] Mara: Great. Moving intentionally like that helps release built-up tension. As you practice these, notice how your body responds—what feels good, what feels resistant. Over time, we can customize these movements further.

[04:25] Mei: That makes sense. I think I can incorporate these into my day, especially if I set a timer for every hour.

[04:25] Mara: Exactly. Consistency is key. Now, I’d like to briefly touch on your pain journal. Have you been tracking your pain episodes and what might trigger them?

[04:30] Mei: Yes, I’ve been noting down times, activities, and how I feel emotionally. It’s revealing to see how closely stress correlates with pain intensity. Sometimes, after a particularly stressful meeting, the pain spikes.

[04:35] Mara: That’s a valuable insight. Recognizing the stress-pain link allows us to develop strategies to manage both. We can work on quick grounding techniques for moments of stress to interrupt that cycle.

[04:40] Mei: I’d like that. I often feel overwhelmed, and then my body protests later.

[04:45] Mara: It’s understandable. Let’s practice a simple grounding exercise now. Place your feet firmly on the ground, close your eyes if you like, and take slow, deep breaths. Imagine roots extending from your feet into the earth, anchoring you. Focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor, the support beneath you.

(Mei follows the instructions, visibly relaxing)

[04:50] Mei: I do feel more centered. It’s like a quick reset.

[04:55] Mara: That’s the idea. Even a minute of this can help shift your nervous system from stress to calm. As we continue, I want to help you build a toolkit of these techniques for different situations.

[05:00] Mara: Before we wrap up, let’s briefly review your goals. You mentioned wanting to manage your pain better, develop sustainable movement habits, and reduce the stress-related tension. How do you feel about your progress so far?

[05:05] Mei: I think I’m starting to see some patterns and feel more in control. The movement exercises are helpful, and I like the body awareness practice. I still have days where I forget to do them, but overall, I’m hopeful.

[05:10] Mara: That’s wonderful to hear. Progress is about small, consistent steps. Next week, we can explore more targeted movement sequences and perhaps work on a customized ergonomic plan based on your workspace. How does that sound?

[05:15] Mei: Sounds perfect. I appreciate the tools and guidance. It’s making a difference.

[05:20] Mara: I’m glad. For homework, keep practicing the breathing and grounding exercises daily, and try to integrate the gentle stretches during your workday. Also, continue your pain journal, noting any patterns or triggers. We’ll review these in our next session.

[05:25] Mei: Will do. Thanks, Mara. Looking forward to next week.

[05:30] Mara: Me too, Mei. Take care of yourself this week, and remember, your body is a good guide—listen to it. See you soon.
