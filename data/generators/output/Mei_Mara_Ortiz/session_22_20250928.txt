Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara: Hi Mei, it’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or insights?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Overall, I think I’ve been more aware of my pain triggers, especially during work. I’ve started noticing that my back tightens up when I’m deep into my emails or meetings. It’s like I can feel the tension building.

[03:10] Mara: That’s a significant step—becoming aware of those patterns. When you notice the tension, what do you usually feel in your body? Can you describe it?

[03:15] Mei: It’s mostly in my lower back, right around my lumbar area. Sometimes I feel a kind of dull ache, other times it’s more like tightness or stiffness. I also notice that my shoulders creep up without me realizing.

[03:20] Mara: That’s quite common with sustained desk work. Let’s do a quick body scan. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and bring your attention to your feet—notice how they make contact with the floor. Then move slowly upward, observing any areas of tension or discomfort. (pause) What do you notice as you scan through your body?

[03:25] Mei: I feel some tightness in my lower back, like a band around it. My shoulders are a bit tense too. I also notice my neck feels a little stiff.

[03:30] Mara: Good awareness. That tightness in your lower back—can you recall when it started or what might have contributed? Was there a specific moment or activity that triggered it?

[03:35] Mei: Well, I guess it’s mostly after long stretches of sitting, especially if I forget to stretch or move around. Sometimes I notice it after a particularly intense meeting where I’m tense or anxious.

[03:40] Mara: That aligns with what I’ve seen in clients who work in high-stress roles. The body reacts to mental stress with physical tension. Have you noticed any other physical sensations or emotional feelings when these tensions arise?

[03:45] Mei: I sometimes feel a bit anxious, like a knot in my stomach, especially when I realize I’ve been sitting for hours. It’s like my body is telling me to pay attention.

[03:50] Mara: That’s an insightful connection—body and mind signaling each other. How do you usually respond when you notice these sensations? Do you pause, stretch, or try to shift your focus?

[03:55] Mei: Honestly, I often just keep working, hoping it’ll go away. Sometimes I do a quick stretch, but I don’t always do it intentionally. More like a reflex.

[04:00] Mara: That’s common. Our bodies develop habits of neglect or quick fixes. Today, I want us to explore some gentle movement and breath techniques to help you create a more conscious response. Would you be open to trying a simple breath exercise now?

[04:05] Mei: Sure, I’d like that.

[04:10] Mara: Great. Sit comfortably, with feet flat on the floor. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, feeling your belly expand. Then exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing tension. Let’s do this together for a few breaths.

(Mara models the breathing, guiding Mei through 3-4 cycles)

[04:15] Mara: How do you feel after that brief breathing practice?

[04:20] Mei: Calmer, actually. My shoulders feel a little looser, and I noticed my mind settling a bit.

[04:25] Mara: Excellent. Breath has a powerful calming effect. Now, I’d like us to incorporate some gentle movement into today’s session—something you can do at your desk to interrupt tension patterns. Have you tried any movement routines recently?

[04:30] Mei: I’ve tried a few stretches here and there, but I haven’t established a consistent routine. Sometimes I forget or feel too busy.

[04:35] Mara: That’s understandable. Building movement habits takes time. Let’s explore a simple movement you can do seated or standing that targets your lower back and shoulders. Would you like to try a gentle torso twist?

[04:40] Mei: Yes, I’m willing to try.

(Mara demonstrates a slow seated torso twist, emphasizing controlled movement and awareness)

[04:45] Mara: As you do this, notice how your body feels during the twist. Breathe naturally, and see if you can sense any release or shift in tension.

(Mei performs the movement, then shares her experience)

[04:50] Mei: I felt a slight release in my lower back, and my shoulders seemed to relax a bit more. It’s a nice reminder that small movements can make a difference.

[04:55] Mara: Exactly. Incorporating these micro-movements throughout your workday can help prevent tension from building up. Now, reflecting on your pain journal from last week—did you notice any patterns or specific triggers you’d like to explore further?

[05:00] Mei: Yes, I noticed that my pain peaks after long stretches of sitting, especially if I haven’t taken breaks or done any movement. Also, I recognize that stress and feeling overwhelmed tend to make my back worse.

[05:05] Mara: That’s valuable insight. It shows that both physical and emotional factors are intertwined. Let’s look at some strategies to address both aspects: perhaps scheduled mini-breaks, intentional breath work during stressful moments, and integrating movement breaks.

[05:10] Mei: I like that idea. I think setting reminders to stand or stretch every 30 minutes could help. Also, I want to practice more intentional breathing during stressful meetings.

[05:15] Mara: Those are excellent strategies. Remember, consistency is key. Over time, these small adjustments can significantly reduce your pain and stress levels. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?

[05:20] Mei: I feel more aware and a bit more in control. The combination of body scan, breathing, and movement feels empowering rather than overwhelming.

[05:25] Mara: That’s wonderful to hear. Before we wrap up, I’d like to assign a couple of gentle practices for you to try during the week—body scanning at the start and end of your workday, intentional breathing during stressful moments, and a quick movement routine every 30 minutes.

[05:30] Mei: Sounds good. I’ll do my best to implement them.

[05:35] Mara: Great. And we’ll review how these go in our next session. Do you have any questions or anything else you want to share today?

[05:40] Mei: Not right now. I appreciate these tools—they make me feel more equipped to handle my pain and stress.

[05:45] Mara: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is gradual, and every small step counts. I look forward to hearing how these practices work for you. See you next week.

[05:50] Mei: Thank you, Mara. See you next week.
