Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or observations?  

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. I’ve been trying to keep up with the movement exercises we discussed, but honestly, the back pain still feels pretty persistent, especially after long workdays. I do notice that I’m more aware of my posture, though. (smiles softly)  

[03:10] Mara: That’s an important step—the increased awareness. Sometimes, just noticing how we hold tension or pain can be revealing. Can you tell me more about what you notice when your pain peaks?  

[03:15] Mei: Usually, it’s around my lower back, right in the middle. It gets worse after I’ve been sitting for a while—say, during meetings or working at my desk. I also catch myself tensing my shoulders without realizing.  

[03:20] Mara: That’s a common pattern, especially with prolonged sitting and stress. Let's try a quick body scan now—close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Just notice any sensations in your back, shoulders, neck, without trying to change anything.  

[03:20] (Mei closes her eyes, takes a deep breath)  

[03:25] Mei: I notice some tightness in my shoulders and a dull ache in my lower back. My shoulders feel heavy, like I’m carrying a weight.  

[03:25] Mara: Good noticing. That heaviness and ache could be linked to tension patterns—possibly from stress or habitual postures. Have you noticed any particular triggers at work that seem to worsen this?  

[03:30] Mei: Yes, especially during back-to-back meetings. I tend to lean forward into my laptop, and my chair doesn’t always support my lower back well. I think I’m unconsciously bracing myself.  

[03:35] Mara: That’s insightful. So, your body might be reacting to mental stress with physical tension, creating a cycle. Let’s explore some gentle breath work now—deep belly breathing to help activate your relaxation response. Would you like to try that?  

[03:35] Mei: Yes, I’d like that.  

[03:40] Mara: Great. Place one hand on your belly, the other on your chest. As you inhale through your nose, feel your belly expand—like a balloon filling up. And as you exhale slowly through your mouth, feel the tension soften. Let’s do three rounds together.  

[03:40] (Pause for breathing)  

[03:45] Mei: (inhales deeply, then exhales slowly) I already feel a bit more grounded.  

[03:45] Mara: Excellent. That calming effect can help reduce the stress-related tension that feeds into your pain. Have you noticed any differences after practicing this at work or home?  

[03:50] Mei: I think I’ve been more aware of my tendency to hold my breath or tense up when I’m stressed. Sometimes I catch myself before it gets too intense. It’s a small shift, but I think it’s helpful.  

[03:55] Mara: That’s a huge step—building awareness and interrupting the tension cycle. Now, regarding your ergonomic setup, have you made any adjustments since our last session?  

[04:00] Mei: Yes, I tweaked my chair height and added a lumbar support pillow. I also started using a posture feedback app that vibrates if I slouch. It’s a bit distracting but effective.  

[04:05] Mara: That’s fantastic—using technology as a tool for mindful positioning. How does your back feel now after these adjustments?  

[04:10] Mei: It’s better overall, but I still get those sharp discomforts after long periods. I think I need to incorporate movement into my day more deliberately.  

[04:15] Mara: Absolutely. Movement is key. Let’s discuss some gentle, micro-movements you can do during work—like seated rotations or gentle stretches—which can break the static tension. Would you like to try a quick movement sequence now?  

[04:15] Mei: Yes, please. I think that would help.  

[04:20] Mara: Okay, sit upright, feet flat on the floor. Inhale as you slowly twist your torso to one side, hold for a breath, then exhale as you return to center. Repeat to the other side. Let’s do three reps each way.  

[04:20] (Mei performs the movements)  

[04:25] Mei: I can feel some relief already, especially in my shoulders.  

[04:25] Mara: Great. These small movements can be integrated into your work routine to reduce stiffness and prevent pain escalation. How do you feel about establishing a routine of brief movement breaks every hour?  

[04:30] Mei: That sounds doable. I can set reminders on my phone. I think it’ll help me stay more aware and prevent the tension from building up.  

[04:35] Mara: Perfect. Now, reflecting on our previous sessions, you mentioned that tracking your pain and stress levels helped you notice patterns. Have you found any new insights or connections?  

[04:40] Mei: Yes, I’ve realized that my pain peaks on days I’m particularly stressed or have tight deadlines. I also see that on days I do my breathing exercises or movement breaks, the pain feels less intense.  

[04:45] Mara: That’s valuable awareness—seeing the link between your practices and how your body responds. It reinforces that small, consistent actions can make a real difference.  

[04:50] Mei: I agree. It’s encouraging to notice these patterns and know that I have some control over my pain.  

[04:55] Mara: Excellent progress, Mei. As we move forward, I’d like you to keep up with your movement and breath practices, and start noting any changes in your pain or stress levels. We can also explore more targeted somatic techniques next time.  

[05:00] Mei: Sounds good. Thanks, Mara. I’m feeling more hopeful about managing this now.  

[05:00] Mara: I’m glad to hear that. Before we close, let’s set a small goal for the week—perhaps to do those micro-movements and breathing exercises daily and track how you feel.  

[05:05] Mei: I can do that. I’ll also keep using the posture app and my pain journal.  

[05:10] Mara: Perfect. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Take good care until then, Mei.  

[05:10] Mei: Thank you, Mara. Have a great week!
