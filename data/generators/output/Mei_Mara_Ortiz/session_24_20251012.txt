Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or moments you want to share?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been pretty stressed at work lately—more than usual. My back pain has been a bit worse, especially after long meetings or sitting at my desk for hours. I’ve been trying to stick with the movement exercises we discussed, but it’s been challenging to stay consistent.

[03:10] Mara: That sounds tough, especially when stress levels are high. It’s common for stress to amplify physical discomfort. Do you notice particular patterns or times when the pain spikes or becomes more intense?

[03:15] Mei: Yeah, definitely. Usually at the end of the day, after I’ve been sitting and working non-stop. I get this tightness in my lower back and sometimes a dull ache that radiates down my legs. I also feel more tense overall—shoulders tight, neck stiff.

[03:20] Mara: That’s a valuable insight—recognizing those patterns helps us target specific triggers. Have you noticed any physical habits during those times? For example, how are your posture or breathing during long work sessions?

[03:25] Mei: I tend to slouch quite a bit, especially when I get distracted or overwhelmed. My breathing becomes shallow, mostly chest breathing instead of deep belly breaths. I think I hold my breath unconsciously when I get stressed.

[03:30] Mara: That’s very common. Shallow breathing can increase tension and make pain feel worse. It’s good you’re aware of it. As we discussed before, integrating mindful body scanning and breath work can really help. Would you like to try a quick body scan now to reconnect with your body?

[03:35] Mei: Yes, I’d like that. It’s been a while since I did a full body scan.

[03:40] Mara: Great. Let’s start by finding a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes if that feels okay, and take a few deep breaths—in through your nose, out through your mouth. (pauses) Now, bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations—warmth, tingling, heaviness?

[03:45] Mei: I feel a bit of warmth in my toes, but also some tightness around my arches.

[03:50] Mara: Good. Now, slowly move your awareness upward—your ankles, calves, knees. What do you notice there?

[03:55] Mei: My calves feel a bit tense, especially on the right side. I also notice some pressure behind my knees.

[04:00] Mara: Noticing those sensations is a great step. Moving up to your hips and lower back—what do you observe there?

[04:05] Mei: My lower back feels tight, especially on the right again. I think I’ve been holding a lot of tension there without realizing.

[04:10] Mara: That’s common, especially if you’re sitting for long periods. Now, bringing awareness to your upper body—your shoulders, neck, jaw. How are those areas?

[04:15] Mei: My shoulders are pulled up a bit, and my neck feels stiff. I catch myself clenching my jaw sometimes.

[04:20] Mara: Noticing that tension is important. Let’s take a few deep breaths now—inhale to expand your belly, exhale to soften those tight areas. (pause) How does that feel?

[04:25] Mei: Better. I already feel a little more relaxed, especially in my shoulders.

[04:30] Mara: Excellent. Remember, body scanning like this can be a quick anchor during your workday—just a minute to reconnect and reset. Now, I’d like to shift into some gentle movement. Do you feel ready for that?

[04:35] Mei: Yes, I think so. I’ve been meaning to incorporate more movement but haven’t known where to start.

[04:40] Mara: Let’s do some gentle pelvis tilts and spinal rotations. These can relieve lower back tension and improve mobility. Lie down if you’re comfortable, or stay seated—whichever feels best.

[Mei nods, shifting to a seated position]

[04:45] Mara: Good. Place your hands on your hips or thighs. As you inhale, arch your back slightly—lifting your chest and tilting your pelvis forward. Exhale, flatten your back, tucking your tailbone under. Repeat slowly—pay attention to how your body feels.

[Mei: Okay, I’ll try.]

[04:50] Mei: (slow movements) I notice that when I tilt forward, my lower back stretches a bit, but I can also feel some tightness there. When I tilt back, my abdomen engages, and I feel a gentle release.

[04:55] Mara: Perfect. Moving into gentle spinal rotations—twist your torso to one side, hold briefly, then switch. Keep your hips stable, and focus on gentle, controlled movements.

[05:00] Mei: (rotating slowly) That feels good. I notice that I’m more aware of my back and core than I usually am during the day.

[05:05] Mara: That’s a great sign. These small movements help break up stiffness and can reduce pain over time. Plus, they promote better posture awareness. How does your body feel now compared to earlier?

[05:10] Mei: Slightly lighter, more open. The tension in my shoulders and back has decreased a bit.

[05:15] Mara: Excellent progress. I want to check in about your stress levels—do you notice any shifts after this movement?

[05:20] Mei: Yes, I feel calmer, more centered. It’s like I took a moment to breathe and reconnect.

[05:25] Mara: That’s exactly what movement and breath work can do—help regulate your nervous system. Now, thinking about your work habits, what small changes could you implement to prevent back pain and reduce stress?

[05:30] Mei: I could set a timer to remind myself to stand up and stretch every hour. Also, maybe adjusting my chair or desk height to improve ergonomics.

[05:35] Mara: Those are excellent ideas. And incorporating brief body scans or breathing exercises during those breaks can reinforce awareness and relaxation. Have you considered keeping a pain or stress journal to track patterns?

[05:40] Mei: I’ve started digital journaling, noting when pain worsens and what I was doing. It’s helped me see some patterns, like feeling more tense after meetings.

[05:45] Mara: That’s a valuable tool. You’re already making great progress understanding your body and habits. Over the next few weeks, we can explore more movement routines tailored to your workday and refine your stress management techniques.

[05:50] Mei: I’d like that. It’s encouraging to see some progress and have practical steps.

[05:55] Mara: Wonderful. Before we finish today, I’ll assign you a brief daily body scan and a breathing exercise to do during work. Also, continue your journaling and note any changes. Does that sound good?

[06:00] Mei: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thanks, Mara.

[06:05] Mara: You’re welcome, Mei. Remember, your body’s signals are valuable guides. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care until then.
