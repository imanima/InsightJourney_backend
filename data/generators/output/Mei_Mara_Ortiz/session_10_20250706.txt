[03:00] Mara: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or moments you'd like to share?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks, I’ve been okay. I’ve noticed my back pain has been a bit more manageable during the week, especially after doing some of the breathing exercises we practiced last time. But overall, it’s still pretty persistent, especially during long work hours.

[03:10] Mara: That’s good to hear that the breathing is helping a bit. Persistent pain can be frustrating, but it’s promising that you’re noticing some relief. When you say “more manageable,” how does that feel in your body? Are there specific times or activities where you notice improvements or setbacks?

[03:15] Mei: Well, I think I’m better at catching the tension before it gets too bad. For example, during meetings, I try to pause and do a quick body scan or breathe deeply. It kind of resets my posture and eases the discomfort. But at the end of the day, I still feel pretty stiff and sore, especially in my lower back.

[03:20] Mara: That’s a very mindful approach—using body scanning and breath during meetings. It shows good awareness. Can you tell me more about what you notice during these scans? Are there particular areas of tension or patterns that stand out?

[03:25] Mei: Yes, I notice a lot of tightness around my shoulders and upper back, but also a kind of dull ache in my lower back. Sometimes I realize I’ve been holding my breath without realizing it, especially when I’m focused or stressed.

[03:30] Mara: That’s insightful. Holding your breath can contribute to muscle tension and even pain. Let’s explore that a bit—what do you notice happening in your body when you realize you’re holding your breath? Do you feel a shift when you intentionally breathe more deeply?

[03:35] Mei: When I remember to breathe deeply, I feel a sense of release. My shoulders soften, and my lower back feels less tight. It’s like I’m giving my nervous system a little reset. But I tend to forget in the middle of busy work.

[03:40] Mara: That’s very common. Memory and habit play big roles here. Over the next few weeks, we can work on building more automatic responses—like gentle reminders or cues—so these practices become more integrated into your routine. How does that sound?

[03:45] Mei: That sounds good. I’d like that. Because honestly, I keep thinking I just need to push through, but I see now that these small pauses could make a real difference.

[03:50] Mara: Absolutely. Small, consistent practices often lead to significant change. Now, have you noticed any patterns in your pain that relate to your work habits or specific tasks? For example, certain types of meetings, times of day, or activities?

[03:55] Mei: Yeah, definitely. My pain tends to get worse in the late afternoon, especially after back-to-back meetings and long periods of sitting. I also notice that when I’m stressed about deadlines, my discomfort increases, especially in my lower back and hips.

[04:00] Mara: That’s a valuable observation. Stress can heighten physical tension. Let’s connect that with somatic awareness—when you start feeling stressed or your pain intensifies, what sensations do you notice first? Is it a tightening, a dull ache, or something else?

[04:05] Mei: Usually, I feel a tightening in my hips and a kind of burning or dull ache in my lower back. Sometimes my shoulders creep up without realizing, which makes my neck tense up.

[04:10] Mara: Noticing those early signs is key. Next, we can work on a quick body scan or breath technique you can do right at your desk when you start feeling that tension. Would you like to try a short body scan now, focusing on those areas?

[04:15] Mei: Yes, I’d like to try that. It’s helpful to have a bit of guidance.

(They proceed with a brief guided body scan, focusing on shoulders, hips, and lower back, incorporating breath awareness.)

[04:25] Mara: How does that feel? Did you notice any shifts or new insights?

[04:30] Mei: It felt good. I think I was holding a lot of tension in my hips and lower back without realizing. Focusing on my breath helped me relax those areas a bit.

[04:35] Mara: That’s great. Remember, these small check-ins can become a habit. Over time, they can help you catch tension early and prevent it from escalating. Now, based on what you shared about your work environment, how is your ergonomic setup? Any adjustments you’ve made or want to explore?

[04:40] Mei: Actually, I’ve been working on that. I adjusted my chair height, added a lumbar support, and I use a stand-up desk for part of the day. I still get sore, but I think these changes are helping.

[04:45] Mara: Those are excellent steps. Ergonomics plays a big role in managing pain. We can also explore some gentle movement routines you can do during breaks to complement these adjustments. Would that be helpful?

[04:50] Mei: Yes, definitely. I sometimes feel stiff after sitting a while, and I’d love some simple stretches or movements I can do at my desk.

[04:55] Mara: Perfect. We’ll incorporate some movement therapy techniques tailored for your workspace next time. For now, I want you to keep practicing the body scans and breath work during stress or tension. And perhaps, set a gentle reminder every hour to check in with your body.

[05:00] Mei: I will do that. It feels good to have some tools I can use throughout my day.

[05:05] Mara: Excellent. Before we finish today, let’s briefly touch on your goal of developing sustainable movement habits. How are you feeling about integrating movement into your weekly routine?

[05:10] Mei: Honestly, I find it challenging to stay consistent. My schedule is unpredictable, but I want to find a way to make movement more habitual, not just something I do when I remember.

[05:15] Mara: That’s a common challenge. We can explore creating a flexible but regular movement plan, maybe short daily routines that fit into your day. Over the next sessions, we’ll work on building those habits gradually. How does that sound?

[05:20] Mei: That sounds very helpful. I want to make it easier on myself, not more stressful.

[05:25] Mara: Exactly. Remember, progress is about consistency, not perfection. And your awareness and effort are already leading to positive changes. So, for next steps—continue your breathing and body scan practices, incorporate brief movement breaks, and observe your pain patterns and triggers.

[05:30] Mei: Got it. Thanks, Mara. I feel more hopeful about managing my pain and stress now.

[05:35] Mara: I’m glad to hear that, Mei. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll continue building on these tools. Take good care until then.

[05:40] Mei: Thank you. See you next week.
