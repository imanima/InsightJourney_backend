Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How are you feeling today? Any particular thoughts or sensations you've noticed since our last session?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. I’m doing okay, I guess. I’ve been a bit more aware of my back pain during the day, especially after long meetings. It’s like a dull ache that sticks around. Sometimes I feel tense in my shoulders too.

[03:10] Mara: That’s good awareness—to notice those patterns. When you say the ache is dull and persistent, does it feel localized or more spread out? And what about the tension in your shoulders—where do you feel it most?

[03:15] Mei: It’s mostly in the lower back, near the lumbar area. And my shoulders feel tight, mostly around the upper traps and neck. During meetings, I catch myself hunching forward or tensing up without realizing.

[03:20] Mara: That’s very common, especially with desk work and screens. Have you noticed any specific triggers or times of day when the pain or tension intensifies?

[03:25] Mei: Yes, actually. The late afternoon is worse—after several hours at my desk. I also notice my neck gets tight when I’m under pressure or feeling stressed.

[03:30] Mara: That aligns with what many of my clients experience—a connection between stress, posture, and physical discomfort. Let’s explore that a bit. Would you be comfortable doing a quick body scan now, noticing where you feel tension right this moment?

[03:35] Mei: Sure, I can do that.

(Mei takes a moment, pauses slightly, then begins a gentle body scan. Her shoulders are visibly tense.)

[03:35] Mara: Great. As you scan your body, notice any areas that feel tight or heavy, without trying to change anything—just observe.

[03:40] Mei: Okay. I notice my shoulders are tight, especially on the right side. My lower back feels a bit achy, and my neck is stiff.

[03:45] Mara: Noticing these sensations is a powerful step. Now, let’s focus on your breath. Can you take a slow, deep inhale through your nose, filling your belly and chest? And exhale gently through your mouth.

[03:50] Mei: (Inhales slowly) Okay. (Exhales) That feels a bit better.

[03:55] Mara: Good. Deep breathing can help release some of that tension. When you breathe in, imagine inviting in relaxation. When you exhale, imagine releasing tightness and stress from your body.

[04:00] Mei: I like that visualization. It makes me feel a little more in control.

[04:05] Mara: Excellent. Now, considering your pain pattern—particularly around the lower back—have you noticed any movements or positions that seem to alleviate or worsen it?

[04:10] Mei: Yes, I think when I stretch my hips or do some gentle twists, the pain lessens a bit. But I tend to forget to move throughout the day, especially when I’m focused on work.

[04:15] Mara: That’s understandable. Small, regular movement breaks can make a big difference. Have you tried incorporating brief stretches or micro-movements into your work routine?

[04:20] Mei: I’ve tried a few, like neck rolls and shoulder shrugs, but I haven’t been consistent. My schedule gets busy.

[04:25] Mara: Consistency is key, and even short, 2-minute movement sessions every hour can help. Let’s talk about your workspace setup—do you feel your desk and chair support good posture?

[04:30] Mei: I think so, but I’ve been meaning to optimize it more. I use a standing desk sometimes, but I still get into slouching positions without realizing.

[04:35] Mara: That's common. Awareness is the first step. Since you already use a wearable posture feedback device, how has that been working for you?

[04:40] Mei: It’s helpful. I get alerts when I slouch, but sometimes I ignore them or forget to adjust.

[04:45] Mara: That’s natural. It takes time to develop new habits. Have you noticed any patterns in when you tend to slouch or lose awareness?

[04:50] Mei: Usually when I’m deep into a task or feeling stressed, I catch myself slumping forward, especially if I’m focused on my screen.

[04:55] Mara: That’s insightful. Stress often triggers poor posture. Now, thinking about your stress levels—have you noticed physical signs besides tension, like headaches or fatigue?

[05:00] Mei: Yes, definitely. I get occasional headaches and feel more exhausted at the end of the day, even if I’m not doing intense work.

[05:05] Mara: That’s a good connection. Stress manifests physically in many ways. Our goal is to create a body-mind awareness that helps you recognize these signs early. Moving forward, I’d like us to integrate some gentle movement and breath practices during your workday. Would that feel manageable?

[05:10] Mei: Yes, I think I can do that, especially if it helps with the pain and stress.

[05:15] Mara: Perfect. For next week, I’d like you to try setting a timer to remind you to stand, stretch, or do a body scan every hour. Also, continue your pain journaling—note any activities, positions, or feelings that seem to influence your discomfort.

[05:20] Mei: Will do. I’ve been keeping a digital journal, so I’ll make sure to include these details.

[05:25] Mara: Great. And in our next session, we’ll review your experience, refine your movement habits, and explore more body awareness techniques. How does that sound?

[05:30] Mei: Sounds good. Thanks, Mara. I already feel a bit more aware just talking through these patterns.

[05:35] Mara: That’s wonderful, Mei. Remember, progress is about small steps. I’ll see you next week, and in the meantime, be gentle with yourself.

[05:40] Mei: Thank you. See you then.

(They both smile softly as the session concludes.)
