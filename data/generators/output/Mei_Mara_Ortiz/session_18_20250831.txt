03:00 [03:00] Mara: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
Mei: Hi Mara. Honestly, I’ve been okay, but I’ve noticed my back pain is a bit more persistent this week. It’s like a dull ache that’s always there, especially after long meetings.  
Mara: Thanks for sharing that. Let’s start by checking in with your body. How does your back feel right now, as you sit there?  
Mei: Um, it’s a bit tight, especially around my lower back and the right side, closer to my hip. I’ve been sitting at my desk a lot more lately.  
Mara: Noted. We’ve talked before about how your work setup might influence this. Do you want to briefly describe your current workspace setup?  
Mei: Sure. I’ve adjusted my chair and monitor height, but I still tend to slouch or lean forward when I get busy. Sometimes I forget to sit upright.  
Mara: That’s common. Small adjustments can make a big difference. Today, I’d like us to focus on sensing these tensions and exploring how your body responds to stress. Does that sound good?  
Mei: Yes, I’d like that. I think I’ve been feeling more stressed lately, and I want to understand how it’s affecting my body.  

[03:10] Mara: Great. Let’s begin with a brief body scan. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and just notice any areas of tension or ease. Starting from your feet, moving upward.  
Mei: (pauses, then breathes deeply) Okay. I notice my feet feel grounded, but my shoulders are tight. My neck feels a bit stiff, especially on the right side.  
Mara: Good observation. As you notice that tension, can you tell if there’s any particular story or emotion attached to it?  
Mei: (pauses) I think I feel a bit overwhelmed, like I’m carrying a lot of mental weight. That might be why my shoulders are tight.  
Mara: That’s insightful. Often, physical tension reflects emotional states. Now, let’s do some breath work. Inhale slowly for four counts, hold for two, then exhale for four. Would you like to try that?  
Mei: Yes. (inhales) One, two, three, four. Hold. (pause) Two. Exhale. One, two, three, four.  
Mara: Excellent. Let’s repeat that a few more times. With each exhale, imagine releasing some of that mental weight.  

[03:20] Mara: How does that feel so far?  
Mei: It helps. I feel a bit calmer, and I notice some of the tension in my shoulders easing. Still, my back is aching, especially on the right side.  
Mara: That’s normal. The body often takes time to release stored tension. We’ll work with that. I want to introduce a gentle movement aimed at easing those lower back tightness. Would you be open to a simple pelvic tilt exercise?  
Mei: Yeah, I think I can do that.  
Mara: Great. Lie down on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. As you inhale, gently tilt your pelvis to flatten your lower back into the floor. As you exhale, release. Let’s do that together.  

[03:30] Mei: (follows instructions) Okay, I feel that in my lower back. It’s a small movement but feels good.  
Mara: Perfect. This movement helps to mobilize the lumbar area and can reduce stiffness. Notice how your back feels after a few repetitions.  
Mei: It’s a bit looser, less tight. I can see how this might help with the persistent ache.  
Mara: Exactly. Incorporating this into your daily routine could gradually ease that tension. Now, let’s talk about your pain journaling. Have you been tracking patterns or triggers?  
Mei: Yes, I’ve been noting when the pain is worse. It’s mostly after long periods of sitting, especially during back-to-back meetings. Sometimes I notice it gets worse when I’m stressed or multitasking.  
Mara: That’s valuable data. It suggests a connection between stress, posture, and pain. We can work on some mindful pauses at work—maybe a quick body scan or breath check-in every hour. Would that be manageable for you?  
Mei: I think so. I usually have reminders set, but I forget to actually pause. Maybe I need to be more intentional about it.  
Mara: Absolutely. Setting an intention and awareness are key. Over time, these small pauses can help break the cycle of tension.  

[03:40] Mara: From our previous sessions, you mentioned difficulty maintaining movement routines. How has that been?  
Mei: It’s still a challenge. I get caught up in work and forget to stretch or move. I do some stretching during breaks, but not consistently.  
Mara: That’s normal. Let’s find a movement you enjoy and can do regularly. Perhaps a brief morning or evening routine?  
Mei: I like the idea. Maybe something simple like gentle spinal twists or shoulder rolls.  
Mara: Perfect. I’ll send you a short sequence tailored for your back and shoulders, designed to fit into your schedule. Would you like to practice one now?  
Mei: Yes, I’d like that.  

[03:50] Mara: Great. Let's do a seated twist. Sit upright, feet flat, shoulders relaxed. Inhale, lengthen your spine. As you exhale, gently twist to the right, holding the chair or your lap. Breathe into the twist, feeling it in your back and shoulders.  
Mei: (follows) That feels nice. I can feel some tension releasing.  
Mara: Excellent. Repeat on the other side. Remember, gentle movements are the goal, not forcing. Over time, this can help improve your mobility and reduce pain.  

[04:00] Mara: Before we finish, I want to check in on your emotional experience. How are you feeling right now?  
Mei: I feel a bit more grounded, calmer than at the start. I think understanding how stress affects my body helps me feel more in control.  
Mara: That’s wonderful. Recognizing the mind-body connection is a big step. As we continue, we’ll build on this awareness and integrate movement and breath to support your wellbeing.  

[04:10] Mara: For next week, I’d like you to try the pelvic tilts daily and practice the seated twist a few times. Keep tracking your pain and note any changes. How does that sound?  
Mei: It sounds good. I’m motivated to keep working on this.  
Mara: Great. And if any new patterns or challenges come up, feel free to reach out. We’ll continue to refine your approach.  

[04:20] Mara: Anything else you’d like to share or ask before we wrap up today?  
Mei: No, I think I’m good for now. Thanks, Mara. This session always helps me reconnect with my body.  
Mara: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, your body is an ongoing conversation—listen with kindness. See you next week.  

[04:30] Mara: Take care, Mei. Have a mindful rest of your day.  
Mei: Thank you, you too.
