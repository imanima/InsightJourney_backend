Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or experiences with your pain or stress levels?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks, I’ve been okay. I’ve noticed that sometimes my back pain fluctuates more during the week, especially on busy days. I’ve been trying to pay more attention to my posture, but it’s still a challenge. I also felt a bit more aware of how my stress seems to flare up when I sit for long periods. 

[03:10] Mara: That’s a helpful observation. It’s common for stress to manifest physically, especially in areas like the back and shoulders. Have you noticed any particular patterns or triggers that seem to worsen your pain or discomfort?

[03:15] Mei: Yes, definitely. Long meetings or deep focus sessions seem to make my back tighten up more. I’ve also caught myself tensing my jaw and shoulders when I get overwhelmed. Sometimes, I feel this kind of tightness creeping up my neck and upper back.

[03:20] Mara: That’s a very insightful connection. Tension in the jaw and shoulders can often be linked to stress and sustained focus. Today, I’d like us to explore how your body responds during these moments—using body scanning and breath work—to help you develop more awareness and tools to manage these responses. Would that feel okay?

[Mei nods] 

[03:22] Mara: Great. Let’s start with a quick body scan. I invite you to close your eyes or soften your gaze, and take a few deep breaths. As you breathe in, notice where you might feel tension or discomfort in your body. And as you breathe out, see if you can soften or release any tightness. 

(Mei follows along, breathing slowly)

[03:30] Mara: What are you noticing as you scan your body? Any specific areas where tension feels more prominent?

[03:32] Mei: I notice a lot of tightness in my lower back and my shoulders. My jaw feels clenched, too, especially when I think about upcoming deadlines.

[03:35] Mara: That’s very common, especially with work stress. The body often holds onto tension in these areas. Now, let’s try a simple breath technique—a kind of gentle breathing to help ease that tension. As you inhale, imagine drawing breath into those tight areas, and as you exhale, imagine releasing or softening them.

(They practice for a minute or two)

[03:40] Mara: How does that feel? Do you notice any shifts in your body or your mental state?

[03:42] Mei: I do feel a bit more relaxed, especially in my shoulders. The tightness in my back is still there, but it’s softer somehow.

[03:45] Mara: That’s a good sign. Sometimes, just bringing awareness and a gentle breath can start to loosen those tight areas. Now, thinking about your work routine—are there specific moments when you notice yourself tensing up the most?

[Mei nods] 

[03:50] Mei: Yes, during back-to-back meetings, especially when I’m on calls that require a lot of concentration. I tend to forget to move or check my posture.

[03:55] Mara: That’s an important insight. It’s easy to get so absorbed that we neglect body signals. For next week, I’d like you to try incorporating short movement or breath pauses every 30 minutes—just a minute or two—to check in with your body. Perhaps even a quick stretch or shoulder roll.

[04:00] Mei: That sounds doable. I think I can set reminders on my phone for that.

[04:05] Mara: Excellent. Also, I’d love to explore how your pain patterns relate to your posture and movement habits. Have you been tracking your pain or journaling about when it intensifies?

[Mei] (nodding) Yes, I’ve been keeping a digital journal and noting when I feel discomfort or tension. It’s been helpful to see the patterns—like how certain positions or times of day seem worse.

[04:10] Mara: That’s very valuable information. Over time, this will help us identify specific triggers and develop targeted strategies. In our next sessions, we can work on integrating movement routines tailored to your daily patterns.

[Mei] (smiling slightly) Thanks. I feel like I’m starting to connect the dots more clearly.

[04:15] Mara: That’s wonderful progress. Remember, body awareness is a skill that develops gradually. The more you tune in and practice these pauses, the more empowered you’ll feel in managing your pain and stress. Before we finish today, do you have any questions or anything you’d like to focus on next time?

[Mei] I’d like to explore some gentle movement sequences that I can do at my desk to prevent the pain from building up. Also, maybe some techniques to release tension in my jaw.

[04:20] Mara: Absolutely. We can incorporate some Pilates-inspired movements that are suitable for office settings, plus some jaw relaxation exercises. I’ll prepare some options for you.

[04:25] Mara: To wrap up, your homework is to continue body scanning and breathing exercises when you notice tension, especially during work. Also, try those short movement breaks and keep tracking your pain and stress levels. Does that sound good?

[Mei] Yes, that sounds great. Thanks, Mara. I already feel a bit more in control.

[04:30] Mara: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress takes time, but each small step counts. I look forward to seeing your notes next week and working on those movement routines. Have a peaceful rest of your day, Mei.

[Mei] Thank you, Mara. See you next week.

[04:35] Mara: See you then. Take care.
