[03:00] Mara: Hi Mei, welcome back. I’m glad we could meet again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? Any notable changes or experiences?  

[03:05] Mei: Thanks, Mara. Honestly, I’ve been pretty busy with work, but I’ve noticed that my back pain has been a bit more manageable this week. I’ve tried paying more attention to my posture, especially during long meetings.  

[03:10] Mara: That’s great to hear. It sounds like you’re starting to integrate some of the ergonomic adjustments we discussed last time. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been noticing physically? Are there particular times or activities where the pain shifts or intensifies?  

[03:15] Mei: Yes, I’ve realized that after sitting at my desk for more than an hour without a break, I start feeling this tightness across my lower back and shoulders. It’s like a dull ache that gets worse if I don’t move around.  

[03:20] Mara: That’s a common pattern, and it’s good you’re observing it. Let’s try a quick body scan now. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you want, and bring awareness to your body—notice any tension or discomfort, starting from your feet up to your head. (Pauses briefly) Where do you feel the most tension right now?  

[03:25] Mei: I’d say my shoulders and lower back. There’s a persistent tightness there.  

[03:30] Mara: Noted. As we go through this, take a few deep breaths, slowly inhaling through your nose and exhaling gently through your mouth. Let’s do that together. (Pauses) Good. Now, as you breathe, imagine sending your breath to those tight areas, inviting relaxation. How does that feel?  

[03:35] Mei: It’s calming, but I still feel a bit of that ache. I think I tend to hold my tension without realizing it.  

[03:40] Mara: That’s very common, especially for people who are disciplined and work in high-stress environments like you. Over time, our bodies adapt by holding tension as a way of managing stress, but it can become habitual. I want to explore that a bit. Have you noticed any particular stress triggers at work that might be contributing to your physical sensations?  

[03:45] Mei: Definitely. When I get overwhelmed with deadlines or if a meeting runs longer than expected, I start feeling this knot forming in my stomach and my shoulders tense up even more. It’s like my body is trying to brace for pressure.  

[03:50] Mara: That’s insightful. Your body is responding to those stress signals even before you consciously realize it. We’ve talked before about how stress and pain can be interconnected — your body's way of signaling that it needs some attention. Have you been able to notice any moments during the day where you can pause and check in with yourself?  

[03:55] Mei: I try to do a quick breath or body check during breaks, but honestly, I often forget when I get caught up in tasks. I think I need more structured reminders.  

[04:00] Mara: That's a good awareness. Building a routine of regular check-ins can help. I can suggest setting gentle alarms or using a movement app to prompt you. Also, incorporating brief movement or breath exercises into your day can break the tension cycle. Would you like us to work on a simple, quick movement sequence for your desk that you can do in 2-3 minutes?  

[04:05] Mei: Yes, that would be helpful. I’ve been meaning to add more movement but haven’t found the right approach that feels sustainable.  

[04:10] Mara: Perfect. Let’s start with a gentle seated spinal twist, neck stretches, and shoulder rolls. I’ll guide you through it now. (Guides through movement sequence) How does your body feel after that?  

[04:15] Mei: Much better. I can feel some release in my shoulders and the tension in my lower back is less noticeable.  

[04:20] Mara: Excellent. Small movements like these, done regularly, can really help manage ongoing tension. Now, let’s talk about your pain journal. Have you been tracking your pain levels and triggers during the week?  

[04:25] Mei: Yes, I’ve been noting when I feel the pain and what I was doing at the time. I’ve seen a pattern—most of the pain comes after long periods of sitting and when I neglect to move or breathe deeply.  

[04:30] Mara: That’s valuable insight. It confirms that movement and breathing are crucial tools for you. I’d like you to keep this journal going and also note any moments of stress or emotional tension that might be linked. Over time, we can look for deeper connections and develop specific strategies to address them.  

[04:35] Mei: That makes sense. I’ve also started using my posture feedback device more consistently, which has been a good reminder to sit awareness.  

[04:40] Mara: That’s fantastic. Technology can be a helpful anchor when combined with body awareness practices. As we approach the end of our session, I want to check in on your overall goals—what feels most important to you right now?  

[04:45] Mei: I want to feel more in control of my pain and stress, so I can focus better at work and not feel drained at the end of the day. I also want to develop habits that last beyond just this session series.  

[04:50] Mara: Those are excellent goals. We’re making steady progress. For next week, I’d like you to continue your pain journaling, practice the quick movement sequence daily, and try to incorporate brief breathing pauses during work. We’ll also explore some deeper somatic techniques to help you access and release stored tension. Does that sound good?  

[04:55] Mei: Yes, it does. Thank you, Mara. I feel more hopeful about managing this now.  

[04:58] Mara: I’m glad to hear that, Mei. Remember, small consistent steps make a big difference. I look forward to seeing your progress next week. Have a good rest of your day.  

[05:00] Mei: Thanks, you too. See you next week.
