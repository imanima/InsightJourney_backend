[15:00] Mara: Hi Mei, welcome back. It's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or experiences you'd like to share?

[15:05] Mei: Thanks, Mara. Overall, I think I’ve been better. I’ve noticed that my back pain has fluctuated—some days worse than others. I’ve been trying to keep up with the journaling we discussed, but I still find myself tense during long work hours.

[15:10] Mara: That’s a good start, Mei. Recognizing those fluctuations is important. When you mention tension during long work hours, can you tell me more about what that feels like physically? Are there particular spots where it’s concentrated?

[15:15] Mei: Mostly in my lower back and shoulders. Especially after sitting at my desk for a couple of hours. I feel this tightness and sometimes a dull ache. It’s like my body is telling me to move, but I get caught up in tasks.

[15:20] Mara: That’s very insightful. It sounds like your body is signaling for movement and perhaps a break from sustained postures. Have you noticed any specific patterns, like certain tasks or times of day when the pain worsens?

[15:25] Mei: Yes, actually. Around mid-afternoon, after I’ve been working for a while, the pain intensifies. I also notice that when I’m stressed about deadlines, I tend to tense up more, which seems to make the pain worse.

[15:30] Mara: That connection between stress and physical tension is very common. When you feel that tension building, do you have any strategies to pause and reconnect with your body?

[15:35] Mei: Not really. I usually just try to push through or stretch quickly, but I know that’s not ideal.

[15:40] Mara: It’s a good awareness that quick fixes aren’t always enough. Today, we can explore some gentle body scans and breath techniques you can incorporate during those stressful moments. How does that sound?

[15:45] Mei: That sounds helpful. I’d like to learn ways to manage that tension better, especially during work.

[15:50] Mara: Great. Let’s start with a brief body scan. I want you to find a comfortable seated position—feet flat, hands resting gently. Close your eyes if that feels okay. Take a deep breath in through your nose… and exhale slowly through your mouth. (pauses) As you breathe, start to bring your awareness to your feet. Notice any sensations or areas of tension.

[15:55] Mei: (takes a deep breath) Okay, I’m feeling some tingling in my toes and a slight tightness in the arch of my right foot.

[16:00] Mara: Good. Now, gently move your awareness up to your calves. Do you notice any tension or tightness there?

[16:05] Mei: Yeah, my calves feel a bit tight, especially on the right side. Like I’m holding tension there without realizing.

[16:10] Mara: That’s common, especially for desk workers. Now, shift your focus to your lower back. Can you notice anything there—any tightness or openness?

[16:15] Mei: I can feel some tightness, mostly on the left side, near my lumbar area. It’s not sharp, but it’s definitely there.

[16:20] Mara: Noticing that tension is a good step. Now, take a few more breaths, imagining sending your inhales to those tight areas, and as you exhale, imagine releasing some of that tension. (pause) How does that feel so far?

[16:25] Mei: Slightly more relaxed, I think. I can see how just checking in like this helps me notice what’s happening in my body.

[16:30] Mara: Exactly. Body awareness is key. Now, I’d like to introduce a simple breath technique you can use during your workday to help manage tension. It’s called diaphragmatic breathing. Would you like to try?

[16:35] Mei: Yes, please.

[16:40] Mara: Great. Place your hand on your belly. Breathe in deeply through your nose, feeling your belly expand. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly soften. Let’s do this together—inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of two, then exhale for a count of six. (pauses for practice) How does that feel?

[16:45] Mei: I think I can do that. It’s a bit challenging to slow down, but I already feel a bit calmer just focusing on my breath.

[16:50] Mara: That’s wonderful. The goal is to incorporate this whenever you notice yourself tensing—maybe during a break or after a stressful email. Over time, it can become a natural response to stress.

[16:55] Mei: I like that idea. It feels manageable.

[17:00] Mara: Excellent. Let’s also briefly revisit your pain journaling. Have you noticed any new patterns or triggers since our last session?

[17:05] Mei: Yes, I’ve started noting the times I feel most pain and what I was doing. Interestingly, I also recorded some moments where I consciously took mini-movement breaks, and I noticed my pain was a bit less afterward.

[17:10] Mara: That’s a powerful insight—your own movement breaks making a difference. It shows how small interventions can have significant effects. Have you tried any specific movements or stretches during your work?

[17:15] Mei: I’ve been doing some gentle neck rolls and shoulder shrugs, but I haven’t incorporated much else.

[17:20] Mara: Those are good start. Over the next week, I’d like you to try adding a few gentle stretches—like seated spinal twists or chest openers—and note how they impact your pain. We’ll review this next time.

[17:25] Mei: Sounds good. I’ll give it a shot.

[17:30] Mara: Perfect. Before we finish today, let’s briefly discuss ergonomic adjustments. You mentioned your desk setup last time—have you made any changes or noticed areas that could be improved?

[17:35] Mei: Yes, I adjusted my chair height and added a lumbar support pillow. I also made sure my monitor is at eye level. I think these help, but I still feel some strain after long sessions.

[17:40] Mara: Those are great steps. Sometimes, small tweaks like alternating between sitting and standing or using a footrest can further improve comfort. Remember, your body is an ongoing conversation—listening and adjusting accordingly.

[17:45] Mei: I’ll keep that in mind. It’s encouraging to see small changes making a difference.

[17:50] Mara: Absolutely. To summarize, today we practiced body awareness through scanning, introduced diaphragmatic breathing for stress management, and discussed integrating gentle movement and ergonomic tweaks into your routine. How are you feeling overall?

[17:55] Mei: More aware of my body and a bit more hopeful that I can manage the tension better. I appreciate these tools.

[18:00] Mara: That’s wonderful to hear. Next session, we’ll build on these techniques and explore any new patterns or challenges you might encounter. For now, I’d like you to continue with the body scans, breath work, and movement journaling. Does that sound good?

[18:05] Mei: Yes, it does. Thank you, Mara.

[18:10] Mara: You’re very welcome. Take care this week, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. Have a great day.

[18:15] Mei: Thanks, you too.
