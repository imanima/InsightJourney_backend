Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Any noticeable changes or patterns you've observed?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. I've been noticing that my back pain is still quite persistent, especially after long hours at my desk. But I did try some of the breathing exercises we discussed last time, and I think they helped a little during stressful moments.

[03:07] Mara: That's good to hear. Breathing can be such a powerful tool. When you say "a little," can you tell me more about what you've noticed? Any particular times or situations where it made a difference?

[03:10] Mei: Yeah, mostly during meetings or when I feel overwhelmed. I pause for a few deep breaths, and I notice my muscles loosen up a bit, especially around my shoulders and neck. But the relief doesn't last very long.

[03:12] Mara: That’s a common experience. Breathing helps to reset your nervous system temporarily, but if the body holds tension, it can quickly rebuild. Have you noticed any specific triggers—like certain tasks or times of day—that tend to worsen your pain or tension?

[03:15] Mei: Definitely. Long periods of sitting without breaks, especially when I’m deep in problem-solving mode. Also, after stressful emails or meetings, I feel more tension in my lower back and shoulders.

[03:17] Mara: That aligns with what many clients experience—stress and prolonged sitting can compound tension. Let's explore your body awareness here. Would you be comfortable doing a quick body scan now, just to notice where you hold tension or discomfort?

[03:20] Mei: Sure, I can do that.

[03:21] Mara: Great. Close your eyes if you like, and take a few slow, deep breaths. Start from your head—what are you feeling there?

[03:23] Mei: I notice a slight tightness around my forehead and temples, like a little tension headache.

[03:25] Mara: Noted. Moving down—what about your shoulders and upper back?

[03:27] Mei: My shoulders feel tight, especially on the right side. Like there's a knot, and it’s pulling a bit into my neck.

[03:29] Mara: And your lower back?

[03:30] Mei: Yeah, that area feels tense and a little achy. It’s like a dull, persistent pain. Sometimes I feel it more after sitting for a long time.

[03:32] Mara: That’s valuable insight. Tension often accumulates in those areas when we’re stressed or sedentary. Have you noticed any patterns in how your breathing feels in these moments? Is it shallow or deep?

[03:35] Mei: I think I tend to breathe shallowly when stressed, especially in my chest.

[03:37] Mara: That’s quite common. Deep diaphragmatic breathing can help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation. Would you like to try a brief breathing exercise now, focusing on expanding your belly with each inhale?

[03:40] Mei: Yes, I’d like that.

[03:42] Mara: Great. Inhale slowly through your nose, imagining your belly expanding like a balloon. Hold for a moment, then exhale gently through your mouth, releasing tension. Let’s do this for a few cycles.

(They pause as Mei practices the breathing exercise)

[03:50] Mara: How do you feel after that?

[03:51] Mei: Much calmer. Breathing into the belly made a noticeable difference. I can feel some of that tension in my shoulders easing a bit.

[03:53] Mara: Excellent. That’s the power of breath. Moving forward, I’d like us to incorporate gentle movement to support releasing tension. Over the past weeks, have you noticed any particular movements or stretches that help?

[03:55] Mei: I’ve tried some gentle neck rolls and upper back stretches, but I often forget to do them during work.

[03:58] Mara: Setting reminders can help. Also, integrating movement into your routine—like brief stretches every hour—can prevent tension from building. Let’s explore some simple, ergonomic movement routines you can do at your desk.

[04:00] (They transition into a brief demonstration of seated spinal twists and shoulder rolls)

[04:03] Mara: How do those feel? Do they help with your tension?

[04:04] Mei: Yes, especially the shoulder rolls. They remind me to relax those muscles consciously. I think I need to keep practicing them.

[04:07] Mara: Consistency is key. Now, considering your work environment, have you made any adjustments to your workspace to support better posture?

[04:10] Mei: Yes, I’ve adjusted my chair and monitor height, and I use a lumbar roll. But I still find myself slipping into poor posture when I get stressed or focused.

[04:12] Mara: That’s normal. Stress can override ergonomic setups. Using cues like reminders or posture feedback devices can reinforce good habits. How comfortable are you with the wearable feedback tools you’re using?

[04:15] Mei: They’re helpful. When I get bad posture alerts, I usually correct myself, but sometimes I forget after a while.

[04:17] Mara: That’s a good start. Over time, these cues can become more habitual. Let’s set a goal: for the next week, aim to pause and check in with your body every 30 minutes, using your tools or a timer, and do a quick body scan or movement.

[04:20] Mei: That sounds manageable. I’ll try that.

[04:22] Mara: Excellent. Also, I want to revisit your pain journal. Have you been tracking your pain levels and triggers consistently?

[04:25] Mei: Yes, I’ve been logging daily, noting times when pain worsens and what I was doing.

[04:27] Mara: Perfect. Any patterns emerging?

[04:30] Mei: Mostly, I see higher pain scores after sitting for over an hour without breaks or during stressful periods. Also, some days I notice more pain in the morning, which I hadn’t connected before.

[04:33] Mara: That's insightful. Morning pain can sometimes be related to overnight tension or poor sleep posture. Have you noticed anything about your sleep habits or pillow support?

[04:36] Mei: I sleep on my side with a supportive pillow, but maybe I need to reassess my pillow’s height or firmness.

[04:38] Mara: Small adjustments there could make a difference. Also, incorporating gentle morning stretches might help release overnight tension. Would you like guidance on that next time?

[04:40] Mei: Definitely. That would be helpful.

[04:42] Mara: Great. To wrap up today, I want you to continue practicing the diaphragmatic breathing, do your scheduled movement breaks, and keep logging your pain and stress levels. We'll review your progress next week.

[04:45] Mei: Sounds good. Thanks, Mara. I feel like I have some practical steps now.

[04:47] Mara: Wonderful. Remember, progress takes time, and your awareness is already a big step forward. See you next week!
