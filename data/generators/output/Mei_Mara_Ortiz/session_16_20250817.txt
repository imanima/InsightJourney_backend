Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

03:00 [Mara]: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Anything new or notable in your body or stress levels this week?

03:05 [Mei]: Hi Mara. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit more tense, especially after some long days at work. My lower back has been bothering me more than usual, and I notice it gets worse when I’m sitting at my desk for extended periods.

03:10 [Mara]: That’s helpful to know. It’s common to see that pattern with prolonged sitting. Have you been keeping up with the pain journaling and the ergonomic adjustments we discussed last time?

03:15 [Mei]: Yes, I’ve been logging my pain levels and trying to be mindful of my posture. I also adjusted my chair height and added a lumbar support. But I still find myself slipping back into that slouched position when I get stressed or distracted.

03:20 [Mara]: That’s a familiar challenge. Sometimes, subconscious stress can pull us into poor postural habits. Let’s do a quick body scan now. Just find a comfortable seated position, and I’ll guide you through noticing where you hold tension today.

(Brief pause as Mei adjusts)

03:25 [Mara]: Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a slow, deep breath in. As you exhale, let your shoulders soften. Now, bring your awareness to your lower back. What do you notice there—tightness, soreness, or maybe a feeling of heaviness?

03:30 [Mei]: I do feel some tightness, especially on the right side near the lumbar area. It’s like a dull ache that’s been persistent.

03:35 [Mara]: Noticing that is a great start. When you observe that tension, can you imagine sending your breath into that area? Maybe visualizing the breath as a gentle wave washing over the tightness?

03:40 [Mei]: I can try. (Pauses) Okay, I’m imagining a slow wave moving into my lower back, easing the tightness a little.

03:45 [Mara]: Excellent. How does that feel? Does it shift the sensation at all?

03:50 [Mei]: A bit. The ache seems less sharp, more like a dull pressure now. It’s comforting to have that visualization.

03:55 [Mara]: That’s wonderful. Visualizing breath can be a powerful somatic tool. Now, thinking about your stress triggers—what situations tend to lead to that tightening or slouching?

04:00 [Mei]: Usually, it’s when I’m overwhelmed with back-to-back meetings or trying to troubleshoot issues quickly. I catch myself leaning forward or slumping when I feel pressured.

04:05 [Mara]: That’s a common response. When stress increases, our body tends to contract or hold tension. Over time, this can reinforce pain patterns. Have you noticed any particular movement or position that helps you reset during these moments?

04:10 [Mei]: Sometimes, if I stand up and stretch briefly or do a neck roll, I feel a bit better. But I haven’t yet integrated movement into my work routine consistently.

04:15 [Mara]: That’s a good insight. Movement can be a key tool for interrupting tension cycles. Let’s explore a simple movement sequence you can do at your desk. It’s gentle, requires minimal time, and targets common areas of tension.

(Brief demonstration of seated pelvic tilts and gentle spinal twists)

04:20 [Mara]: Would you like to try these now? I’ll guide you through.

(They proceed with the movement exercises)

04:25 [Mara]: How did that feel? Do you notice any relief or changes in your tension?

04:30 [Mei]: Yes, I felt my lower back loosen up a bit, and I felt more grounded afterward. It’s like a reset button.

04:35 [Mara]: That’s fantastic. Building in these micro-movements can help manage pain and stress throughout your day. Remember to breathe deeply during them, anchoring your awareness.

04:40 [Mei]: I’ll definitely try to incorporate that. I think I tend to forget to move during busy times.

04:45 [Mara]: That’s common. Setting reminders on your devices or tying movement breaks to certain tasks—like after finishing an email or a meeting—can make it easier. How does your overall work routine feel now? Do you notice any shifts in your awareness or approach?

04:50 [Mei]: I do. I’m more aware of my body and how stress impacts it. I’ve started to pause and do quick checks on my posture, which helps me catch slouching before it becomes a problem.

04:55 [Mara]: Excellent progress. Over the next weeks, we can work on strengthening your body awareness further and integrating more movement strategies. How comfortable do you feel about the pain management techniques we discussed last time?

05:00 [Mei]: I think they’re helpful. Practicing breath awareness and visualization has made me feel more in control. Sometimes, I notice my mind still races, but I can bring it back to my body.

05:05 [Mara]: That’s the essence of somatic work—building a mindful connection to your body. As we move forward, I’d like to introduce some gentle movement flows that can be integrated into your day, and continue to explore how stress manifests physically. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed today?

05:10 [Mei]: Not at the moment. I appreciate the tools and the reminder to be gentler with myself during busy times. I feel more hopeful about managing this.

05:15 [Mara]: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, consistency is key. For next week, I’d like you to practice the breathing and movement exercises daily and keep logging your pain and stress levels. We’ll review your progress and explore any new patterns.

05:20 [Mei]: Will do. Thanks, Mara. I’m looking forward to working on this more.

05:25 [Mara]: Me too, Mei. You’re making great strides. See you next week.
