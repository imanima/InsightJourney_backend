Session 1/24
Date: May 04, 2025
Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How are you feeling today? Any particular sensations or thoughts you'd like to start with?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Honestly, I feel a bit more aware of my back today, especially after last week’s session. There's some tension lingering around my lower back and shoulders, mostly after long work hours. I’ve been trying to be more mindful about my posture.

[03:10] Mara: That’s a good start. Noticing those sensations is key. Can you describe what you’re feeling — is the tension sharp, dull, tight, or maybe a pulling sensation?

[03:12] Mei: It’s mostly a dull ache, but sometimes it feels tight, especially when I sit for too long or when I’m under stress at work.

[03:15] Mara: That aligns with what I’ve heard from many clients in similar roles — prolonged sitting, combined with stress, often leads to that kind of tension. Have you noticed any times during the day when the pain intensifies or eases?

[03:20] Mei: Yes, it tends to get worse in the late afternoon, after many meetings and emails. I also find that when I take short breaks and do some stretching, it helps a little.

[03:25] Mara: That’s insightful. It sounds like movement and breaks are helping you manage the discomfort, which is great. Today, I’d like us to explore how your stress and pain are connected, and see if we can identify patterns or triggers. Would that be okay?

[Mei: Yes, absolutely. I’ve been curious about how my mind and body interact in this context.]

[03:30] Mara: Excellent. To start, I’d like you to do a brief body scan, bringing your attention to how you’re feeling right now. Just observe any areas of tension or ease without trying to change anything. Take your time.

[Mei: (pauses, breathing slowly) Okay. I notice that my shoulders are slightly hunched, and my lower back feels a bit tight. There’s a dull ache, like I mentioned. My chest feels a little tight, too, maybe from stress.]

[03:35] Mara: Good observation. Notice how these sensations relate to your breathing. Is your breath shallow or deep right now?

[Mei: It’s fairly shallow, I think. I tend to hold my breath unconsciously when I’m stressed.]

[03:40] Mara: That’s common. Shallow breathing can increase tension and stress. Let’s do a quick breath exercise. Inhale slowly through your nose for four counts… and exhale gently through your mouth for six counts. Let’s try that together a couple of times.

[Mei: (follows) Inhale… 2, 3, 4. Exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Okay, I already feel a little more relaxed.]

[03:45] Mara: Nice job. Breathing like this can activate your parasympathetic nervous system, helping to reduce tension. Now, I want to connect this to your pain. When you notice stress or tension building during your workday, can you recall how your body responds?

[Mei: I tend to tighten up — shoulders go up, my back gets stiff. Sometimes I even clench my jaw without realizing.]

[03:50] Mara: Those are common responses. Recognizing them is the first step. Over time, we can develop awareness and gentle interventions to interrupt this cycle. Have you noticed any specific triggers at work — certain tasks or times of day that make your pain worse?

[Mei: Yes, definitely during intense meetings or when I have a lot of deadlines. Sometimes I catch myself sitting at my desk, leaning forward, trying to focus, and then I realize I’ve been in that position too long.]

[03:55] Mara: That’s a valuable insight. Posture and mental focus during deadlines seem to be contributing factors. How about your ergonomic setup — have you made any adjustments recently?

[Mei: Actually, yes. I’ve been using a posture feedback device that alerts me when I slouch or lean forward. It’s helped me correct my sitting position more often.]

[04:00] Mara: That’s fantastic. Technology can be a supportive tool. As we progress, we’ll integrate movement strategies to help you break those static positions. For today, I’d like us to explore gentle movement patterns that you can incorporate into your work routine. Would you like to try a simple seated movement now?

[Mei: Yes, I’d like that. Sitting all day is so draining, and I’d love some relief.]

[04:05] Mara: Great. Let’s start with a gentle seated twist. Sit tall, take a deep breath, and as you exhale, gently rotate your upper body to one side, keeping your hips stable. Hold for a few breaths, then switch sides. Focus on smooth, mindful movements.

[Mei: (follows) I can feel that stretch in my back, especially on the right side. It’s nice to move intentionally.]

[04:10] Mara: Excellent. Moving slowly like this helps release accumulated tension and brings awareness to your body’s signals. How does your back feel after that?

[Mei: Slightly more open, less tight. I think I need to do this more often.]

[04:15] Mara: Absolutely. Short movement breaks like this can make a significant difference. As you continue your day, try to incorporate micro-movements or stretches every 30 minutes. Also, keep noticing how stress levels influence your physical sensations. We’ll build on this awareness over time.

[Mei: I like that. It feels manageable and not overwhelming.]

[04:20] Mara: Perfect. Before we finish today, I want to assign a simple journaling exercise. Keep track of times when your pain or tension spikes — note what you were doing, your emotional state, and any physical positions. This will help us identify patterns for our next session.

[Mei: That sounds helpful. I’ll start tonight.]

[04:25] Mara: Great. And remember, your body is always communicating with you. The more you tune in, the better you can manage your pain and stress. For next week, we’ll explore some tailored movement sequences and further body awareness techniques. Any questions before we wrap up?

[Mei: No, I think I have a clear idea. Thank you, Mara. I already feel more in control of my body’s signals.]

[04:30] Mara: I’m glad to hear that, Mei. You’re doing really well. See you next week, and keep practicing those mindful breaks and journaling. Have a peaceful week!

[04:35] Mei: Thank you. See you next week!
