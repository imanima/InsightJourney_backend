[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Any notable changes or patterns you’ve noticed?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. I’ve been paying more attention to my body, especially during work. Honestly, I still feel that tightness in my lower back, but I’ve noticed it’s a bit more predictable now. Like, I can tell when it’s about to flare up.

[03:10] Mara: That’s a great observation—the predictability is a sign that you’re tuning into your body’s signals. Have you been able to catch it early or perhaps apply any of the breathing or movement techniques we discussed last time?

[03:15] Mei: I’ve tried. When I feel that tightness coming on, I pause and do some deep breaths, focusing on slow exhalation. Sometimes I stretch my legs under the desk, but I’m still not consistent with it. It’s like I forget in the moment.

[03:20] Mara: That’s very normal—building new habits takes time. Remember, it’s about creating a gentle awareness rather than perfection. Let’s explore that feeling of tightness a bit more now. I’d like you to do a body scan, starting from your head down to your hips. Just notice any tension or sensations without judgment.

[03:25] Mei: (Pauses, breathing deeply) Okay. My head feels fine, but my shoulders are tense. My chest feels slightly tight too. Going down, my lower back is stiff, and I notice a dull ache near my tailbone.

[03:30] Mara: Excellent awareness. So, the tension is concentrated in your shoulders, chest, and lower back. When you notice these areas, do you see any patterns or triggers that lead to these sensations?

[03:35] Mei: Well, I usually get these sensations after long periods of sitting at my desk—sometimes after meetings, especially if I feel overwhelmed or if I’ve been multitasking. I think stress definitely amplifies it.

[03:40] Mara: That makes sense. Stress often manifests physically, especially in areas where we hold tension unconsciously. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or feelings during those moments of tension?

[03:45] Mei: Mostly, I feel anxious about deadlines or missing details. I tend to ruminate, which probably keeps me in that tension cycle.

[03:50] Mara: That’s very insightful. Recognizing the connection between your thoughts, stress, and physical tension is a big step. Now, let’s incorporate some breath work. I want you to place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, feeling your belly expand—(pause)—and then exhale slowly through your mouth, noticing your belly deflate. Let’s do that a few times together.

[03:55] Mei: (Breathes consciously) Okay, I can feel my belly rising and falling. It’s calming, but I notice my chest still tends to rise first.

[04:00] Mara: That’s common. Try to focus on relaxing your shoulders and chest as you breathe—allow the breath to come from your belly. This helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation. How does that feel?

[04:05] Mei: It feels more grounding. Like I can settle my thoughts a bit. I think I might forget to do this during busy work, but it’s helpful to practice now.

[04:10] Mara: Absolutely. Practice creates new habits. We’ll build on this. Next, I want to introduce a gentle movement that you can do at your desk to release some of that tension. It’s a seated hip flexor stretch—would you like me to guide you through it now?

[04:15] Mei: Yes, please. That would be helpful.

[04:20] Mara: Great. Sit towards the edge of your chair, keep your feet flat on the ground. Step your right foot back, so your leg is extended behind you, and gently press your hips forward. Keep your back straight. Hold for a few breaths, then switch sides. This movement helps release tightness in your hips and lower back, especially after sitting for long periods.

[04:25] Mei: (Follows instructions) Okay, I feel a stretch in my right hip. It’s different from the usual tightness—I think I’m more aware of it now.

[04:30] Mara: Excellent. Noticing that stretch is a sign you’re connecting movement with awareness. Over time, this can help reduce the chronic tension. How does your back feel after this movement?

[04:35] Mei: Slightly better—less stiff. I think I’ll try to integrate this into my work routine, maybe every hour.

[04:40] Mara: That’s a great plan. Consistency is key. Now, let’s briefly revisit your pain journal. Have you noticed any new patterns or insights since last week?

[04:45] Mei: Yes. I recorded a few instances where stress from meetings or deadlines seemed to correlate with increased back pain. Also, on days I skipped my usual stretching, the pain worsened.

[04:50] Mara: That’s valuable information. It shows how your stress and movement habits directly impact your physical state. Moving forward, I want you to continue tracking your pain and any associated thoughts or feelings. Also, notice if the breathing or movement exercises help during those moments.

[04:55] Mei: I will. It’s encouraging to see how small adjustments can make a difference.

[05:00] Mara: Absolutely. You’re making great progress. For our next session, let’s focus on refining your ergonomic workspace setup and exploring additional movement strategies. Do you feel ready to incorporate these practices into your daily routine?

[05:05] Mei: Yes, I do. I think with more practice, I can start managing this better and reduce the tension overall.

[05:10] Mara: Wonderful. Remember, patience and consistency are your allies. Before we finish today, any questions or reflections?

[05:15] Mei: I appreciate how you help me see the connection between my mind and body. It’s motivating to keep working on this.

[05:20] Mara: That’s wonderful to hear. Keep trusting your body’s signals, and we’ll continue building on this progress. I’ll see you next week. Take care, Mei.

[05:25] Mei: Thank you, Mara. See you then.
