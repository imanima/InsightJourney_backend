Session 19/24
Date: September 07, 2025
Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or observations?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. I’ve been feeling a bit more aware of my body lately, especially during work. The pain is still there, but I think I’ve noticed some patterns I didn’t really pay attention to before. (leans forward slightly, expressive)

[03:10] Mara: That’s great to hear you’re becoming more aware. What specific patterns have you noticed? Are there particular times or activities when the pain intensifies?

[03:15] Mei: Yeah, definitely. The pain tends to spike after long periods of sitting—especially after back-to-back meetings or when I’m working on detailed reports. I also notice it gets worse if I forget to take breaks or don’t pay attention to my posture. (fidgets with her hands)

[03:20] Mara: That’s very insightful. It sounds like the combination of prolonged sitting and stress might be contributing. Have you observed any physical sensations or emotions accompanying those pain peaks?

[03:25] Mei: I usually feel a tightness in my lower back and sometimes a dull ache that radiates into my hips. Emotionally, I notice I get a bit tense, almost anxious, like I’m worried about deadlines or making mistakes. (pauses)

[03:30] Mara: It’s interesting how stress and tension show up physically and emotionally. In our previous sessions, we talked about body awareness and using breath to find some relief. Have you been practicing any techniques on your own?

[03:35] Mei: I’ve tried a few breathing exercises, especially when I start feeling stressed, but I sometimes forget or get caught up in work again. I also started tracking my pain in a journal, noting what I was doing when it got worse. (smiles slightly)

[03:40] Mara: That’s a strong start. Journaling is a powerful way to see patterns. Have you noticed any specific activities or postures that seem to trigger or alleviate the pain?

[03:45] Mei: Yes. Sitting upright with proper lumbar support helps a lot. I also feel better when I stand up and stretch or do some gentle movement. But I find it hard to stick to a routine, especially during busy days. (sighs)

[03:50] Mara: It’s understandable. Building sustainable habits takes time and consistency. Let’s explore some movement strategies that can be integrated into your workday without feeling disruptive. Would you be open to a short movement practice now?

[03:55] Mei: Absolutely. I think I need that. (relaxes slightly)

[04:00] Mara: Great. Let’s start with a simple body scan to reconnect with your sensations. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you like, and take a few deep breaths. Focus on noticing where you feel tension or discomfort right now. (guides)

[04:05] Mei: (closes her eyes, takes deep breaths) I notice a tightness in my lower back and some tension around my shoulders.

[04:10] Mara: Good awareness. Now, gently bring your attention to your breath—inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly expand, and exhale softly. As you breathe, imagine sending your breath into those tight areas, inviting relaxation. How does that feel?

[04:15] Mei: It feels a bit calming, but the tightness in my back is still there. I can sense my shoulders holding a lot of tension too.

[04:20] Mara: That’s normal at first. Now, let’s try some gentle movements to release that tension. I’ll guide you through a simple pelvic tilt and shoulder roll sequence. Ready?

[04:25] Mei: Yes, I’m ready.

(Mara guides Mei through gentle pelvic tilts and shoulder rolls, encouraging mindful movement and breath synchronization)

[04:35] Mara: How do you feel after those movements?

[04:40] Mei: More relaxed in my hips and shoulders. I think moving intentionally like that helps me reconnect with my body rather than just working in my head.

[04:45] Mara: Exactly. Small, intentional movements can make a big difference. Moving forward, I’d like you to try incorporating short movement breaks—around 2-3 minutes—every hour during your workday. Also, continue your body journaling and note any movements or postures that help or worsen your pain.

[04:50] Mei: That makes sense. I can set reminders for movement breaks and keep tracking. Do you have any suggestions for specific stretches or exercises I can do at my desk?

[04:55] Mara: Yes. Gentle spinal twists, seated cat-cow stretches, and shoulder blade squeezes are effective and easy to do discreetly. Also, mindful breathing during these can enhance relaxation. Would you like me to send you a quick routine?

[05:00] Mei: That would be great, Mara. Thank you. I think having a clear plan will help me stay consistent.

[05:05] Mara: Of course. Remember, progress is about gentle consistency. Also, continue to observe how your stress levels and physical sensations interact. Over time, these awareness practices can help you catch tension early and manage it better.

[05:10] Mei: I appreciate that. It feels good to have some practical tools and a plan. I’m hopeful about making small changes that add up.

[05:15] Mara: That’s the spirit, Mei. For next week, I’d like you to practice the movement routine and continue your journaling. We can check in on what’s working and any new patterns you notice. Sound good?

[05:20] Mei: Yes, sounds perfect. Thanks, Mara. I feel more grounded after this session.

[05:25] Mara: I’m glad to hear that. Take care this week, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

[05:30] Mei: Thanks again. See you next week.
