Time: 03:00 PM
Client: Mei (Operations Lead)
Professional: Mara Ortiz (Somatic Therapist & Pilates Instructor)

[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, welcome back. It’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[03:03] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. The pain has been a bit better in some moments, but overall still quite persistent. Work has been stressful, too, so I think that’s been affecting me physically.

[03:05] Mara: I hear you. Stress definitely plays a big role in physical discomfort. Would you say that the pain patterns have shifted or stayed the same since our last talk?

[03:08] Mei: Well, I notice that it’s mostly in my lower back, especially after long hours at my desk. Sometimes, I feel it creeping into my hips and even my shoulders. It’s like this dull ache that flares up with certain movements or prolonged sitting.

[03:10] Mara: That’s a common pattern for many of your clients, especially those with desk jobs. Let’s do a quick body scan. Can you find a comfortable seated position and close your eyes if you’re comfortable?

[03:12] Mei: Sure, I’ve got my chair set up.

[03:13] Mara: Great. Take a deep breath in through your nose… and exhale slowly through your mouth. As you do, bring your attention to your feet on the ground. Notice how they feel, any sensations or tension.

[03:15] Mei: Okay. My feet feel grounded, but I notice a slight tingling in my toes.

[03:17] Mara: Good observation. Now, shift your awareness up to your legs. Do you notice any tightness or discomfort around your lower back or hips?

[03:19] Mei: Yeah, I think I hold a lot of tension in my lower back. It feels tight, especially after sitting for a while.

[03:21] Mara: That’s important to acknowledge. As you breathe out, imagine releasing some of that tension. Let’s do a few deep breaths together—inhale to fill your lungs, and exhale to soften your back muscles.

[03:23] Mei: (takes a deep breath) Okay, I can feel my back relaxing a bit.

[03:25] Mara: Excellent. Now, move your awareness into your shoulders. Are they tense right now?

[03:27] Mei: Yes, especially the right shoulder. It feels stiff, like I’ve been holding my stress there.

[03:29] Mara: Noticing that is a great first step. Sometimes, our bodies hold onto stress in specific areas. Over the past weeks, have you noticed any specific triggers or movements that worsen your back pain?

[03:31] Mei: Definitely. Long periods of sitting without moving, especially if I get absorbed in work. Also, sometimes I reach for my phone or computer in a way that strains my neck and shoulders.

[03:34] Mara: That aligns with what I expected. How about your work setup? Have you tried any of the ergonomic adjustments we discussed last time?

[03:36] Mei: Yes, I’ve adjusted my chair height and added a lumbar support. I also started taking short breaks every 30 minutes to stand and stretch. It’s helped a little, but I still get that dull ache after a while.

[03:39] Mara: That’s progress. Small, consistent movements make a big difference. Have you noticed any particular times of day when the pain intensifies?

[03:41] Mei: Usually late afternoon, around 4 or 5 pm, when I’ve been sitting for hours and my energy dips.

[03:43] Mara: That makes sense. When our energy and focus wane, tension tends to build up. So, integrating gentle movement during those times could help. Would you be open to a short movement sequence now, tailored to ease your lower back and shoulders?

[03:45] Mei: Yes, I’d like that. I think I need some guidance on how to move better during work.

[03:47] Mara: Perfect. Let’s do a simple seated spinal twist followed by some shoulder rolls. Sit upright, breathe deeply, and as you exhale, gently twist your torso to the right, placing your left hand on your thigh and your right hand on the back of your chair. Hold for a breath or two.

[03:50] Mei: (twists gently) That feels good. I can feel some release in my back.

[03:52] Mara: Excellent. Now, come back to center. Let’s do some shoulder rolls—lift your shoulders up toward your ears on an inhale, then roll them back and down on the exhale. Repeat a few times.

[03:55] Mei: (does the movement) That’s helping loosen up my shoulders a lot.

[03:57] Mara: Great. These small movements can interrupt tension buildup. How does your body feel now compared to before?

[04:00] Mei: Definitely more relaxed, especially in my shoulders. My back still feels tight, but I can sense that the tension has eased a bit.

[04:02] Mara: That’s wonderful progress. Remember, incorporating these movements regularly during your workday can prevent some of that pain from escalating. Now, let’s talk briefly about your stress levels. Have you noticed any ways your stress manifests physically besides the back pain?

[04:05] Mei: Yeah, I tend to clench my jaw at night and sometimes get headaches. During the day, I catch myself holding my breath or tensing my stomach when I’m anxious.

[04:07] Mara: Those are common responses to stress. Breath awareness and gentle body scans throughout the day can help you catch those patterns early. Would you like to try a simple breath technique now?

[04:09] Mei: Yes, please.

[04:10] Mara: Great. Sit comfortably, place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Take a slow, deep inhale through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale gently through your mouth, feeling your belly fall. Focus on slow, diaphragmatic breathing for a few minutes.

[04:12] Mei: (breathes slowly) I can feel my tension easing as I breathe like that.

[04:15] Mara: Excellent. Consistent practice can help you manage stress responses better and reduce the physical manifestations. As we wrap up, how are you feeling about your pain management plan moving forward?

[04:17] Mei: I feel more equipped. The body scans and movement exercises are helpful, and I want to be more disciplined about taking breaks and practicing breathing throughout the day.

[04:20] Mara: That’s a great intention. Remember, body awareness is a skill that deepens over time. For next week, I’d like you to keep a brief pain and stress journal, noting what activities or times seem to trigger or alleviate discomfort. Also, try incorporating these movement and breath techniques during your workday.

[04:23] Mei: Will do. Thanks, Mara. This session helped me reconnect with what my body needs.

[04:25] Mara: You’re doing really well, Mei. Progress is gradual, but consistent effort makes a difference. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care and be gentle with yourself.

[04:27] Mei: Thanks, Mara. See you next week.

[04:28] Mara: See you then. Have a great rest of your day.
