[03:00] Mara Ortiz: Hi Mei, it's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Anything new or notable in your body or stress levels?

[03:05] Mei: Hi Mara. Thanks. Honestly, I’ve been okay, but I’ve noticed my back pain has been a bit more manageable this week, especially after I’ve done some stretches. Still, I feel a tightness building up by the end of the day, particularly around my lower back and shoulders.

[03:10] Mara Ortiz: That’s good to hear about the stretches helping. Sometimes, even small movements can make a difference. When you mention that tightness builds up, can you recall when it starts—like a particular time or activity?

[03:15] Mei: Usually around late afternoon, after I’ve been at my desk for a couple of hours. I notice my posture getting more slumped, and my shoulders creep up toward my ears.

[03:20] Mara Ortiz: That makes sense. It sounds like there's a pattern between your work posture and the pain. Let’s do a quick body scan now—just tune in to what you’re feeling right now. Starting from your head, down through your shoulders, back, and legs. Take a few deep breaths as we go.

[03:25] (Mei closes her eyes briefly, takes a deep breath)  

Mei: Okay, I notice my shoulders feel tense, especially the right one. My lower back feels a bit tight, and my neck is slightly stiff.

[03:30] Mara Ortiz: Good observation. Noticing these sensations is the first step. When you feel that tension, do you notice any particular emotions or thoughts accompanying it?

Mei: Hmm, I guess I feel a bit frustrated. Like I know I should stretch or move more, but I get caught up in work, and it just piles up.

[03:35] Mara Ortiz: That’s very insightful. Frustration and perhaps a sense of being overwhelmed. It’s common when we feel caught in a cycle. Let’s try a simple breathing technique now—deep belly breathing—to help manage that tension. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold for two, then exhale gently for four. Would you like to try?

Mei: Yes, I can do that.

[03:40] (Mei follows the breath work, visibly relaxing a bit)

Mara Ortiz: Excellent. Notice how the breath can connect you to your body and create a moment of pause. When you’re ready, I’d like us to explore your pain journaling briefly. Have you been tracking your pain levels and triggers daily?

Mei: Yes, I’ve been using my app to log pain intensity and what I was doing. I noticed that certain tasks, like sitting for long meetings, tend to increase the pain, especially when I forget to adjust my posture.

[03:45] Mara Ortiz: That’s very valuable data. It shows a clear link. Do you recall any particular moments where you caught yourself before the pain escalated, or was it mostly reactive?

Mei: Mostly reactive. I realize now that I often don’t notice until it’s already uncomfortable, which makes it harder to change anything in the moment.

[03:50] Mara Ortiz: That’s common. Building awareness in real time is a skill we can develop. For example, during your work, setting gentle reminders to check in with your body could help. Maybe a quick posture check every 20 minutes. How does that sound?

Mei: That sounds doable. I think I could set those reminders on my phone or use my wearable to prompt me.

[03:55] Mara Ortiz: Perfect. Your wearable can be a great tool for that, providing real-time feedback on your posture. Now, considering your chronic pain, I’d like to introduce some movement integration—simple, mindful movements you can do at your desk. Are you open to that?

Mei: Yes, I’d love to learn some movements I can do without interrupting my work too much.

[04:00] Mara Ortiz: Great. Let’s do a few seated pelvic tilts, which can help release some tension in your lower back. Sit upright, place your feet flat on the floor, and gently tilt your pelvis forward and back, feeling the movement in your lower spine. Let’s do ten repetitions together.

(Mei follows Mara’s guidance, visibly relaxing as she moves)

Mei: That feels good. I can see how that might help with the stiffness.

[04:05] Mara Ortiz: Excellent. Small, regular movements like this can prevent the buildup of tension. Over time, integrating these into your routine can make a big difference in managing pain. Have you noticed any other areas of tension or discomfort that we should address next time?

Mei: Well, I think my neck and shoulders are still a concern, especially since I tend to text or look at my phone a lot during breaks.

[04:10] Mara Ortiz: That’s very common. We can explore gentle neck stretches and awareness exercises next time. Also, I’d like us to revisit your work ergonomics to see if further adjustments can be made.

Mei: That would be helpful. I’ve already made some tweaks, but I think there’s room for improvement.

[04:15] Mara Ortiz: Perfect. Before we wrap up today, I want to commend you for your consistency with journaling and awareness. That’s a big step toward managing your pain and stress. For your next steps, I suggest continuing the body scans, breath work, and incorporating brief movements during your day. Also, keep tracking your pain and triggers.

Mei: Thank you, Mara. I feel like I’m starting to understand my body better, and these tools give me a sense of control.

[04:20] Mara Ortiz: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, progress is gradual, and every small step counts. I look forward to seeing how these practices evolve for you. Our next session, we can focus more on neck tension and further ergonomic tips.

Mei: Sounds great. Thanks so much, Mara.

[04:25] Mara Ortiz: You’re welcome, Mei. Take care, and I’ll see you next week. Have a mindful day.
