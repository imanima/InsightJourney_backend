[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:02] Alex: Hey, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The past week was tough — I had that big presentation at work, and I kept feeling like I wasn’t prepared enough, even though I knew I was.

[10:04] Dr. Harper: That sounds stressful. When you say you felt unprepared, what specific thoughts were going through your mind?

[10:06] Alex: Mostly, that I’m going to mess up or that I don’t really know enough to lead this project. I kept thinking, “What if I make a mistake and everyone notices?” It’s like that perfectionist voice is really loud right now.

[10:08] Dr. Harper: That’s very common, especially for someone in your creative and detail-oriented role. You mentioned the perfectionist voice—can you tell me more about how that shows up for you?

[10:10] Alex: Well, I guess it’s like, if I don’t get every pixel perfect or if I don’t have a flawless presentation, I’ll be seen as a failure. I get stuck in that cycle of overthinking, and it makes me anxious, sometimes even paralyzed.

[10:12] Dr. Harper: It sounds like that inner critic is quite persistent, reinforcing fears of failure. Have you noticed any specific triggers lately that turn on that perfectionism or anxiety?

[10:14] Alex: Yeah, actually. Every time I get a new project, especially if I don’t have all the details upfront, I start worrying I won’t meet expectations. Also, streaming my work on Twitch sometimes adds pressure—I worry people are watching and judging every move.

[10:16] Dr. Harper: That’s interesting. The streaming adds an extra layer of visibility, which likely amplifies perfectionism. Considering this, what core beliefs do you think underlie these thoughts? For example, do you see yourself as only valuable if your work is perfect?

[10:18] Alex: Yeah, I think that’s true. I’ve always tied my self-worth to doing really good work. If I mess up, it feels like I’m not enough.

[10:20] Dr. Harper: That’s a powerful insight. It aligns with the internal narrative that your value depends on perfection. How does that belief serve you? And how might it be holding you back?

[10:22] Alex: It’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it pushes me to excel, but on the other, it makes me afraid to try new things or take risks. I hold back sometimes because I’m afraid of failing publicly.

[10:24] Dr. Harper: It’s understandable. It’s like you’re caught between wanting to excel and fearing the consequences of imperfection. Over our months working together, we’ve looked at evidence against these beliefs. Have you noticed any instances that contradict the idea that you’re only valuable if perfect?

[10:26] Alex: Actually, yes. After that failed launch, I got some positive feedback from my team saying I handled the situation well, and that I’m a strong leader. But I still have trouble internalizing that.

[10:28] Dr. Harper: That’s a great example of evidence that challenges your belief. Sometimes, our emotional responses lag behind the facts. How might you work on integrating that positive feedback into your self-view?

[10:30] Alex: Maybe I could keep a journal or a list of those successes and positive comments, so I see them more often.

[10:32] Dr. Harper: Excellent idea. Using evidence like that can help reframe your core beliefs over time. Now, thinking about your work boundaries—how are you managing your time and energy lately?

[10:34] Alex: Honestly, it’s hard. I tend to work late into the night, especially when I’m anxious about upcoming deadlines. I feel guilty stepping away, like I’m wasting time or not being productive enough.

[10:36] Dr. Harper: That guilt is common among high-achievers. Have you noticed if this pattern affects your sleep or overall well-being?

[10:38] Alex: Yeah, definitely. I’ve been waking up several times during the night, and I feel drained during the day. It’s like I’m stuck in a cycle of overwork and exhaustion.

[10:40] Dr. Harper: Sleep hygiene and rest are crucial. We’ve talked before about some strategies, like establishing a wind-down routine and setting firm boundaries around work hours. How consistent have you been with those?

[10:42] Alex: Not very. I keep telling myself I’ll start tomorrow, but then I get caught up in the next project and just keep going.

[10:44] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. Sometimes it helps to set small, achievable goals—like turning off work notifications by 7 pm or doing a mindfulness exercise before bed. Would you be willing to try that this week?

[10:46] Alex: Yeah, I can do that. I think I need to start small.

[10:48] Dr. Harper: Great. And regarding your confidence in leadership, what are some strengths you see in yourself that you might be underestimating?

[10:50] Alex: I guess I am good at communicating ideas clearly and motivating my team. I also tend to stay calm under pressure, which others seem to appreciate.

[10:52] Dr. Harper: Those are valuable qualities. Sometimes, our inner critic overshadows our strengths. Can you practice affirming these traits when self-doubts arise?

[10:54] Alex: I’ll try to remind myself of that. Maybe I can write down those strengths and review them when I feel anxious.

[10:56] Dr. Harper: That’s a wonderful strategy. To wrap up today, what’s one action step you’re willing to commit to before our next session?

[10:58] Alex: I’ll start a strengths journal, and I’ll implement the work boundary routines we discussed. Also, I’ll practice mindfulness for 5 minutes before bed.

[11:00] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Those sound like achievable steps. Remember, progress takes time, and being gentle with yourself is part of the process. We’ll review how these go next week. Any final thoughts or questions?

[11:02] Alex: No, I think that covers everything. Thanks, Harper.

[11:04] Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Alex. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a good day.
