[10:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Alex, good morning! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:03] Alex: Hey, Dr. Torres. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve had some days where I feel more confident, but others where I’m stuck in that perfectionism spiral again. That launch last week didn’t go as planned, and I’ve been ruminating about it.

[10:06] Dr. Torres: That sounds tough. It’s completely normal to have those ups and downs, especially after a setback like that. Would you like to start by sharing what specific thoughts or feelings came up for you during and after the launch?

[10:09] Alex: Yeah, I kept thinking, “I should have caught that mistake earlier,” or “Maybe I’m just not good enough for this role.” I felt like I failed my team, even though I know logically that one launch doesn’t define me.

[10:12] Dr. Torres: Those are really common perfectionist thoughts—“I should have,” “I’m not good enough.” It sounds like you’re holding yourself to very high standards. Do you recall if these thoughts are familiar from past experiences?

[10:15] Alex: Yeah, definitely. Even before this project, I’d get anxious about delivering perfect work. Sometimes I’d spend hours tweaking a design just to make it “perfect,” even if my team said it was ready.

[10:18] Dr. Torres: That pattern of perfectionism seems persistent. Let’s explore the core beliefs behind these thoughts. When you’re thinking, “I’m not good enough,” what does that say about how you see yourself?

[10:21] Alex: I guess I see myself as someone who should always be on top of things, never slip up, and constantly impress others. If I fail, it feels like I’m exposing some fundamental flaw.

[10:24] Dr. Torres: So, there’s a belief that your worth is tied to your perfect performance. That’s quite common among high achievers, especially in creative fields like design. Do you remember if this belief has been reinforced over time?

[10:27] Alex: Yeah, I think so. Growing up, I was praised for being talented, but also criticized when I made mistakes. I think I internalized that I had to prove myself constantly.

[10:30] Dr. Torres: That’s insightful. It sounds like your early experiences set a foundation where mistakes are seen as failures rather than learning opportunities. How does that belief impact your current work and self-view?

[10:33] Alex: It makes me hesitant to take risks, and sometimes I avoid sharing my ideas openly because I fear they’re not good enough. It’s exhausting trying to always be perfect.

[10:36] Dr. Torres: It’s understandable. Perfectionism can be quite draining and can hold you back from fully engaging. Given what we’ve discussed, what would you say is the core belief you’d like to work on shifting?

[10:39] Alex: Probably that I don’t have to be perfect to be valuable or successful. That making mistakes is part of growth, not a sign of failure.

[10:42] Dr. Torres: That’s a powerful and compassionate shift. We can work on cognitive restructuring around that belief. Remember last time we talked about collecting evidence for and against these thoughts? Would you like to try that now?

[10:45] Alex: Sure. I guess I can think about that launch. The mistake I made was small, and I fixed it quickly. My team still appreciated my work overall.

[10:48] Dr. Torres: Excellent start. So, the evidence against the thought “I failed completely” is that your mistake was minor and corrected promptly, and your team still values your contributions. How about evidence supporting the thought? Do you see any?

[10:51] Alex: Well, I did have that moment of panic and felt like I let everyone down, even if that wasn’t entirely true.

[10:54] Dr. Torres: That’s honest. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings without letting them define the entire experience. How does this evidence affect your core belief?

[10:57] Alex: It makes me realize that I sometimes overgeneralize my mistakes as failures of character, not just specific events.

[11:00] Dr. Torres: That’s a great insight. Remember, part of our goal is to develop a more balanced view—seeing mistakes as opportunities rather than failures. How does practicing mindfulness help you in moments of anxiety or perfectionism?

[11:03] Alex: When I pause and focus on my breath, it helps me slow down and realize that my thoughts aren’t the whole truth. It’s like creating space between me and the anxiety.

[11:06] Dr. Torres: Exactly. Mindfulness can be a powerful tool to observe your thoughts without judgment. Let’s do a brief mindfulness exercise now. I’ll guide you through a breathing practice.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: How do you feel after that short practice?

[11:12] Alex: More centered. It’s helpful to step back from the thoughts and just notice them.

[11:15] Dr. Torres: Great. Now, considering your goal to build confidence and manage perfectionism, what small step can you take this week to challenge these perfectionist tendencies?

[11:18] Alex: I think I’ll try to intentionally share an idea in our team meeting without overthinking it first, even if I worry it’s not perfect.

[11:21] Dr. Torres: That’s a fantastic plan. Taking small risks like that can help reshape your beliefs about mistakes and value. Before we close, let’s review your action items: continue practicing mindfulness daily, collect evidence about your perfectionism triggers, and share at least one idea in your next meeting.

[11:24] Alex: Sounds good. I’ll also keep track of my thoughts and feelings using my mood tracker app.

[11:27] Dr. Torres: Perfect. And we’ll revisit these insights next week. You’ve made great progress today—remember, change takes time, and every step counts. Any final questions or thoughts before we wrap up?

[11:30] Alex: No, I think that’s a good plan. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel more hopeful about managing this.

[11:33] Dr. Torres: I’m glad to hear that. See you next week, Alex. Take care!
