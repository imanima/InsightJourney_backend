[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:02] Alex: Hi, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling more anxious, especially around work deadlines, but I also had some moments where I felt a little more in control. 

[10:05] Dr. Harper Torres: Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like there have been some ups and downs. Do you notice any specific triggers that tend to heighten your anxiety or perfectionism? 

[10:07] Alex: Yeah, I think it’s mostly when I’m facing a new project or a tight deadline. I get stuck overthinking every detail, and then I worry that I’m not doing enough or that my work isn’t good enough.

[10:09] Dr. Harper Torres: That’s a common experience, especially with perfectionism. It sounds like your mind is really focused on avoiding mistakes or criticism. Have you noticed any particular thoughts that come up during these moments?

[10:11] Alex: Yeah, I often think, “If I don’t get this perfect, I’ll be a failure,” or “Everyone else is doing better than me.” It’s like this internal pressure that’s hard to turn off.

[10:14] Dr. Harper Torres: Those are powerful beliefs. They can really amplify your anxiety. Let’s explore those a bit. Do you remember from previous sessions how we talked about challenging core beliefs? 

[10:16] Alex: Yeah, I remember. We discussed how these beliefs aren’t always based on reality.

[10:18] Dr. Harper Torres: Exactly. One technique we use is cognitive restructuring. So, when you notice those thoughts—like “I’ll be a failure”—what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that?

[10:21] Alex: Well, I guess I’ve made mistakes before, but I’ve also had successes. Like, I did launch a product that got positive feedback, even if it wasn’t perfect.

[10:23] Dr. Harper Torres: That’s a great observation. Sometimes, our mind focuses on flaws or worst-case scenarios, ignoring our achievements. How does recalling your successes affect your feelings about your work?

[10:25] Alex: It helps me realize that I’m more capable than I sometimes give myself credit for. But then, in the moment, it’s hard to hold onto that perspective.

[10:27] Dr. Harper Torres: That’s normal. A mindfulness technique we can incorporate is to pause and notice these thoughts without judgment. When you catch yourself spiraling, take a breath and remind yourself of the evidence you just mentioned. Would you be open to trying a quick mindfulness exercise now?

[10:29] Alex: Sure, I can try.

[10:30] Dr. Harper Torres: Great. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in. As you breathe out, notice any tension or racing thoughts. Just observe them without trying to change or judge. (pauses) Now, bring to mind a recent success or achievement, no matter how small.

[10:35] Alex: (takes a breath, then smiles slightly) Okay. I remember finishing that last design sprint even when I was feeling overwhelmed. The client loved it, and I got positive feedback.

[10:37] Dr. Harper Torres: That’s excellent. Just hold onto that feeling of accomplishment. When those critical thoughts come back, gently remind yourself, “I’ve succeeded before, and I can do it again.” How does that feel?

[10:39] Alex: A bit more grounding, actually. Like I have some evidence to counter the negative thoughts.

[10:41] Dr. Harper Torres: Perfect. It’s about building that mental habit. Now, earlier you mentioned work-life balance issues. Can you tell me more about what’s happening there?

[10:43] Alex: Yeah, I’ve been working late a lot lately, trying to perfect my designs, but it’s taking a toll on my sleep and personal time. I feel guilty stepping away, even when I’m exhausted.

[10:45] Dr. Harper Torres: That guilt can be powerful. It’s often tied to perfectionism—believing that if you're not working, you're not doing enough or aren’t worthy. Have we discussed any strategies to set healthier boundaries around work?

[10:47] Alex: We touched on it in the first session, but I haven’t really implemented anything yet. I just keep telling myself I need to do better.

[10:50] Dr. Harper Torres: That’s understandable. One approach is to establish clear start and end times for your workday, and prioritize self-care outside those hours. Also, using a visual cue—like a timer—can help enforce those boundaries. Would you like to brainstorm some specific steps to implement this?

[10:52] Alex: Yeah, I think setting a strict cutoff time, like 6 pm, could help. Maybe I can also put my phone away after that.

[10:55] Dr. Harper Torres: Those are great ideas. And perhaps during the week, you can journal or reflect on how it feels to stick to those boundaries. This can help reinforce the positive effects. How does that sound?

[10:57] Alex: It sounds doable. I think I need to remind myself that I deserve downtime and that it won’t ruin my work.

[10:59] Dr. Harper Torres: Absolutely. Building confidence in that belief is key. For next week, let’s set a goal for you to practice these boundaries and to notice any thoughts or feelings that come up. Also, continue using mindfulness to manage those perfectionist tendencies. Does that work?

[11:02] Alex: Yes, I’ll try. Thanks, Harper.

[11:03] Dr. Harper Torres: Great. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling overall today?

[11:05] Alex: Better than at the start. The mindfulness exercise helped, and I have some clear steps to work on. It’s reassuring.

[11:07] Dr. Harper Torres: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, progress is often in small steps. Keep track of your successes, and I look forward to hearing about how these strategies work for you next week.

[11:09] Alex: Thanks, Harper. See you next time.

[11:10] Dr. Harper Torres: Take care, Alex. Have a good week.
