**[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres:** Hi Alex, good morning. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
**[10:02] Alex:** Hi, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a mixed bag. I’ve had some good days, but I also felt pretty overwhelmed a few times, especially after the last product launch.  
**[10:04] Dr. Harper:** That’s understandable. Launches can really stir up a lot of pressure. Do you want to tell me more about what specifically felt overwhelming?  

**[10:07] Alex:** Yeah, I think it’s mostly the fear of not being good enough—imposter syndrome kicking in big time. Even after the project was successful, I kept thinking maybe I got lucky or I’ll mess up the next one.  
**[10:09] Dr. Harper:** That’s a common experience, especially with high-stakes work. It sounds like you're battling some persistent self-doubt, even when evidence shows otherwise. Have you noticed any particular triggers that make these feelings worse?  

**[10:12] Alex:** Definitely. When I see colleagues praising the project, or when I compare my work to others’ on social media, that’s when the doubts spike. Also, when I set really high standards for myself—perfectionism seems to be at the core.  
**[10:15] Dr. Harper:** It’s interesting that you mention perfectionism. It often feeds into imposter feelings because if you’re never 'perfect enough,' it’s easy to think you’re not deserving. Have you noticed any patterns in your thinking around these moments?  

**[10:17] Alex:** Yeah, I tend to think, “If I don’t get this right, I’ll be exposed as a fraud,” or “I should have known better.” It’s like this constant inner critic.  
**[10:20] Dr. Harper:** That inner critic can be relentless. Let’s try to examine those thoughts. When you have the thought, “If I don’t get this right, I’ll be exposed,” what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that?  

**[10:23] Alex:** Well, I guess I’ve been successful most of the time. My work has been well-received, and I’ve had positive feedback from clients and team members. But that voice still says I’m just lucky.  
**[10:25] Dr. Harper:** So, there’s evidence of your competence and success, yet the doubt persists. This is where cognitive restructuring can help. Let’s practice identifying and challenging these automatic thoughts regularly. Would you like to try reframing that “luck” thought now?  

**[10:28] Alex:** Sure. I guess I could think, “My success is due to my skills and effort, and I’ve earned it.” But honestly, it’s hard to fully believe that sometimes.  
**[10:30] Dr. Harper:** That’s a very honest reflection. Building belief takes time. Remember, it’s about accumulating evidence—like your positive feedback, completed projects, and skills—and gradually trusting that. We can work on a specific thought record after today’s session.  

**[10:33] Alex:** Sounds good. I also wanted to talk about my work boundaries. I tend to overwork because I feel like I need to prove myself, which just leads to burnout.  
**[10:36] Dr. Harper:** That’s a common challenge among high-achievers. Overworking can feed into perfectionism and anxiety. Have you noticed specific triggers that push you to overextend?  

**[10:38] Alex:** Yeah, especially when I have a looming deadline or when I feel behind on my tasks. Also, sometimes I get caught up in ‘building in public’ on Twitch, which makes me want to perfect everything I share.  
**[10:41] Dr. Harper:** Ah, the ‘building in public’ aspect. That’s a double-edged sword—your community appreciates transparency, but the perfectionism can make it hard to set healthy boundaries. How do you feel about setting limits on your work or streaming time?  

**[10:44] Alex:** I’ve thought about it, but I worry that I’ll disappoint my followers or fall behind. Plus, I get into this mode where I think I need to keep showing progress.  
**[10:47] Dr. Harper:** It’s understandable. Part of this process is redefining what ‘progress’ looks like—quality over quantity, for example. Maybe we can develop some specific strategies to help you set boundaries without feeling guilty. Would you be willing to try scheduling designated ‘work’ and ‘break’ periods and practicing mindfulness during transitions?  

**[10:50] Alex:** Yeah, I think that could help. I’ll give it a shot. Also, I want to improve my confidence in leadership—sometimes I hesitate to speak up in meetings because I doubt my ideas.  
**[10:52] Dr. Harper:** Building confidence as a leader is a great goal. Do you recall any recent situations where you hesitated and what you thought was holding you back?  

**[10:55] Alex:** Last week, I had an idea about streamlining our onboarding process, but I kept quiet because I thought it might be too basic or not innovative enough. Then I saw others sharing similar ideas later.  
**[10:58] Dr. Harper:** That’s a great example. Sometimes, the fear of not being ‘original’ or ‘valuable’ can silence us. A useful approach here is to remind yourself that your perspective is valid—and your ideas, even if simple, contribute to the team. We can work on some affirmations and evidence you can collect to reinforce your confidence. Would you like to practice that now?  

**[11:00] Alex:** Yes, I’d like that.  
**[11:02] Dr. Harper:** Excellent. Let’s also review your progress since the last session. You mentioned practicing mindfulness, right? How has that been going?  

**[11:05] Alex:** I’ve been trying to do a five-minute breathing exercise each morning. It helps me start the day a bit calmer, but I sometimes forget or get distracted during the day.  
**[11:07] Dr. Harper:** That’s normal, especially when starting. The key is consistency, not perfection. Maybe setting a reminder or pairing it with another routine—like after your coffee—could help. We can also explore different mindfulness techniques in our next session, if you’re interested.  

**[11:09] Alex:** Yeah, I’d like to try that. Overall, I think I’m making some progress, but the imposter syndrome and perfectionism still linger.  
**[11:11] Dr. Harper:** Progress is often gradual, and it’s encouraging to hear you’re aware and committed. Today, I want us to focus on building evidence for your strengths and practicing cognitive flexibility. As homework, I’ll send you a thought record template to track automatic thoughts and challenge them. Also, let’s plan to review your boundary-setting plan next week.  

**[11:13] Alex:** Sounds good. Thanks, Harper. I feel like I’m learning to be kinder to myself, even if it’s hard sometimes.  
**[11:15] Dr. Harper:** That’s a wonderful insight, Alex. Self-compassion is vital. Remember, progress isn't about being perfect—it's about becoming more aware and gentle with yourself. Next week, we can continue to build on these strategies. Anything else you want to address today?  

**[11:18] Alex:** No, I think that covers it. Thanks for the support.  
**[11:20] Dr. Harper:** You’re very welcome. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences with the thought records and boundary work. Have a good week, Alex.  

**[11:21] Alex:** Thanks, Harper. See you next time.
