**[10:00] Dr. Torres:** Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or events you'd like to share?  

**[10:03] Alex:** Hey, thanks. Honestly, it’s been a mixed week. I had a big launch at work, and I felt pretty anxious beforehand—more than usual. But I think I handled it okay, though I still kept replaying some moments where I felt like I might have messed up.  

**[10:05] Dr. Torres:** That sounds challenging. It’s great you recognize those moments—recognition is a key step. When you think back on the launch, what specific thoughts or beliefs come up?  

**[10:07] Alex:** Well, I kept thinking, “What if I’m not good enough?” or “They’ll realize I don’t really know what I’m doing.” I guess I still struggle with that imposter syndrome.  

**[10:10] Dr. Torres:** That’s very common, especially after a setback like a failed launch. It sounds like those thoughts are really persistent. Do you notice any physical sensations or feelings when those thoughts come up?  

**[10:12] Alex:** Yeah, I get this tightness in my chest, and my stomach feels unsettled. Sometimes my hands get a bit sweaty too.  

**[10:15] Dr. Torres:** Those physical cues can be helpful indicators. In our previous sessions, we discussed how perfectionism and imposter syndrome often feed into each other. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that tend to set off these feelings?  

**[10:17] Alex:** Definitely. When I see a new project or receive feedback—especially if it’s critical—I start to doubt myself. Also, comparing myself to others on design communities or Twitch streams.  

**[10:20] Dr. Torres:** Comparing yourself to others is a common trigger. Let’s explore that a bit. Can you tell me about a recent example where comparison led to self-doubt?  

**[10:22] Alex:** Sure. I was watching a streamer who shared their process on a complex UI design, and I felt like I don’t do enough, or my work isn’t as innovative. Immediately, I thought, “I should be pushing myself harder,” but then I just felt overwhelmed and anxious.  

**[10:25] Dr. Torres:** That sounds like a classic perfectionism loop—comparing your work to someone else's polished process. Would it help to examine the evidence? For instance, what are some things you’ve achieved recently that you’re proud of?  

**[10:27] Alex:** Well, I did finish that new feature last week, and my team liked it. The launch was smooth, and I got positive feedback from my manager.  

**[10:30] Dr. Torres:** Those are significant accomplishments. It’s important to acknowledge your successes alongside your challenges. Sometimes our internal critic focuses only on the negatives. Would you be willing to practice a cognitive restructuring exercise now, to challenge some of those automatic thoughts?  

**[10:32] Alex:** Yeah, I think that could help.  

**[10:35] Dr. Torres:** Great. So, when you think, “I’m not good enough,” what’s the evidence for and against that?  

**[10:37] Alex:** For it, I’d say I’ve had moments of self-doubt, and I’ve made mistakes. Against it, I have finished projects, received praise, and learned from feedback.  

**[10:40] Dr. Torres:** Excellent. So, the evidence suggests you are competent and capable, even if you sometimes doubt yourself. How might you reframe that thought into something more balanced?  

**[10:42] Alex:** Maybe, “I’ve made mistakes, but I also have a track record of success and growth.”  

**[10:45] Dr. Torres:** That’s a strong, balanced statement. Repeating this can help reduce the intensity of imposter feelings over time. Now, considering your perfectionism, how does this tendency influence your work and stress levels?  

**[10:47] Alex:** I think it pushes me to do my best, which is good, but sometimes I get stuck chasing perfection and never feel satisfied. I procrastinate or avoid tasks because I fear they won’t be perfect enough.  

**[10:50] Dr. Torres:** That’s a common pattern. In our past sessions, we’ve discussed setting more realistic standards and embracing ‘good enough’ at times. Have you tried using deadlines or specific criteria to limit perfectionist tendencies?  

**[10:52] Alex:** I’ve started using deadlines more intentionally, but I still struggle with letting go of the need for everything to be flawless.  

**[10:55] Dr. Torres:** It’s a process. A helpful technique is to practice mindfulness when you notice perfectionist thoughts arising. For example, taking a moment to observe your thoughts without judgment and reminding yourself that progress is more important than perfection. Would you like to try a brief mindfulness exercise now?  

**[10:57] Alex:** Sure, I can do that.  

**[10:58] Dr. Torres:** Great. I’ll guide you. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. As you breathe, notice any thoughts or feelings related to your work—like the urge to perfect or doubts—and just observe them without trying to change or judge them.  

**(Pause for a moment)**
  
**[11:05] Dr. Torres:** How does that feel?  

**[11:07] Alex:** It’s calming. I think I often forget to pause and just notice my thoughts.  

**[11:09] Dr. Torres:** That’s a valuable insight. Regular mindfulness can help create space between your thoughts and reactions, reducing their power. As part of your homework, I’d like you to practice this mindfulness exercise daily, especially when you notice perfectionist or imposter thoughts.  

**[11:11] Alex:** Okay, I can do that.  

**[11:12] Dr. Torres:** Excellent. Before we wrap up today, let’s briefly review your goals. You mentioned wanting to build confidence and manage perfectionism better. How do you feel about your progress so far?  

**[11:15] Alex:** I think I’ve made some progress—recognizing my triggers, trying cognitive restructuring, and practicing mindfulness. But I still get caught up in doubt and perfectionism more often than I’d like.  

**[11:17] Dr. Torres:** That’s perfectly normal. Change takes time, and you’re building new habits. Remember, setbacks are part of the process. Next week, we can focus on developing specific work boundaries and strategies to reinforce your confidence.  

**[11:20] Alex:** Sounds good. Thanks, Dr. Torres.  

**[11:22] Dr. Torres:** You’re welcome. For next time, keep practicing the mindfulness and cognitive exercises we discussed, and note any situations that trigger your imposter feelings or perfectionism. We'll review those in our next session. Have a great week, Alex.  

**[11:25] Alex:** Thanks, you too. See you next week.  

**[11:26] Dr. Torres:** Take care!
