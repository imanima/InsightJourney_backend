**[10:00]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Hi Alex, good morning. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**Alex:** Hi, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve had some wins, but also a lot of those familiar doubts creeping back in.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s understandable—progress isn’t always linear. Let’s start by checking in on any specific situations from the past week that triggered those doubts or feelings of imposter syndrome?  

**Alex:** Well, last Thursday, I led a team presentation for the new feature rollout. I felt pretty confident beforehand but then, during the actual presentation, I kept second-guessing my ideas, worrying I was missing something obvious.  

**Dr. Torres:** And how did that experience sit with you afterward?  

**Alex:** It was frustrating. I kept replaying parts of it, thinking I could have prepared better. Even though my team said it went well, I couldn’t shake the feeling I fumbled.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a common experience with perfectionism—getting caught up in self-criticism even when others see success. Do you recall if any specific thoughts came up during or after that presentation?  

**Alex:** Yeah, I kept thinking, “They probably think I’m a fraud,” or, “I shouldn’t be leading this; I’m just lucky.”  

**Dr. Torres:** Those are powerful core beliefs—feeling like a fraud or not deserving your role. Let’s explore those a bit. When you notice yourself thinking, “I shouldn’t be leading,” how true do you feel that on a scale from 0 to 100?  

**Alex:** Maybe around 70. I know I have skills, but the doubt still feels very real.  

**Dr. Torres:** It’s good you can rate it honestly. Sometimes, these beliefs feel overwhelming because they’re so familiar. Over the last sessions, we’ve worked on gathering evidence to challenge such thoughts. Can you think of any recent examples where you were successful or competent?  

**Alex:** Well, I did finish the new design module ahead of schedule, and my team actually praised the clarity of my work. Also, I received positive feedback from a client last month for my user flow.  

**Dr. Torres:** Those are excellent examples. Evidence that counters the “not deserving” thought. How does reflecting on those make you feel?  

**Alex:** Slightly better, but the doubts still linger. It’s like they’re part of the background noise I can’t fully tune out.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s normal, and part of what we’re working on—building resilience against those doubts. I want to introduce a quick mindfulness exercise to help you observe these thoughts without judgment. Would you like to try?  

**Alex:** Yeah, I’m willing.  

**[10:20]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Great. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. As you breathe in, silently say to yourself, “I notice.” And as you breathe out, say, “Thoughts come and go.” Just observe your mind and these doubts as passing clouds. No need to analyze or judge them—just notice.  

(They pause for a minute as Alex follows the exercise.)  

**Dr. Torres:** How was that for you?  

**Alex:** It’s a bit strange, but I felt more detached from the thoughts—like I was watching them instead of being caught up in them.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a key skill—creating some space between you and your thoughts. This helps reduce their power over you. Now, considering our work over the past sessions, how do you feel about your progress in managing perfectionism and anxiety around work?  

**Alex:** I think I’ve gotten better at catching the critical thoughts earlier. I also started tracking my mood and work confidence levels in an app we discussed. Seeing some patterns has been helpful.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s wonderful. What patterns have you noticed?  

**Alex:** Well, I tend to feel worse after I spend too much time revising a single design—like I get stuck in this loop of 'it’s not good enough.' But when I set time limits, I feel more confident and less anxious.  

**Dr. Torres:** That aligns with the cognitive-behavioral techniques we’ve explored—setting boundaries and challenging perfectionist thoughts. Have you tried any specific strategies, like scheduling designated revision times?  

**Alex:** Yes, I’ve been limiting revisions to a maximum of two rounds per feature, and I’ve been making a conscious effort to remind myself that “good enough” is okay. It’s still a work in progress, but I notice I’m less paralyzed.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s excellent progress. Remember, building new habits takes time. How are you feeling about your confidence in leading projects overall?  

**Alex:** I’m cautiously optimistic. I still get nervous before big meetings, but I’m starting to recognize those feelings as normal rather than signs of failure.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a significant shift—seeing nerves as normal rather than as proof of inadequacy. Let’s talk about your goal of building confidence in your leadership role. What’s one small step you can take this week?  

**Alex:** I think I’ll volunteer to lead a small workshop for the team next week. Just a 20-minute session on our design process.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a fantastic idea—practical and manageable. How do you feel about preparing for that?  

**Alex:** Honestly, a bit anxious, but also excited. I want to see if I can handle it without my usual self-doubt taking over.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a great mindset. Remember to use your mindfulness and cognitive restructuring tools if doubts arise. Also, it might help to prepare some evidence of your expertise, like past successful presentations or positive feedback.  

**Alex:** Good idea. I’ll compile some notes and testimonials.  

**[10:45]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Excellent. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on sleep and self-care—how have your sleep habits been lately?  

**Alex:** Pretty good, actually. I’ve been sticking to a regular bedtime, and I’ve been using the sleep tracker you recommended. I notice that on nights I do a brief mindfulness exercise before bed, I fall asleep faster.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s fantastic. Consistent sleep hygiene is a crucial part of managing anxiety. How about your work-life balance—any boundaries you’ve been able to set?  

**Alex:** I’ve started shutting down work emails after 7 PM and taking weekends completely off. It’s still challenging, but I feel more in control.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a big step. Maintaining boundaries is vital, especially with your busy design schedule. How are you feeling overall today?  

**Alex:** Honestly, a bit more grounded. Still some doubts, but I feel like I have tools to handle them better.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, progress is about small, consistent steps. For next week, I’d like you to reflect on how the workshop goes and keep tracking your mood and confidence levels. Also, practice your mindfulness exercises daily.  

**Alex:** Will do. Thanks, Harper. I appreciate the support.  

**Dr. Torres:** You’re doing great, Alex. I look forward to hearing about your workshop and your continued growth. See you next week.  

**Alex:** Thanks, see you then.
