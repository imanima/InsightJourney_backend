[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, it’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? (smiles warmly)

[10:05] Alex: Hi, Harper. Thanks. I’ve been okay, I guess. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster—I had that stressful launch last week, and I’ve been feeling pretty anxious about how I handled everything.

[10:10] Dr. Harper: That sounds tough. It’s understandable to feel anxious after a high-pressure event like a product launch, especially if things didn’t go as planned. Can you tell me more about what specifically triggered your anxiety during or after the launch?

[10:15] Alex: Well, I kept worrying that I missed something important, like a detail that could’ve made a difference. Plus, I kept replaying the moments I felt I messed up, even though I know logically I did my best.

[10:20] Dr. Harper: It sounds like you’re experiencing some perfectionistic tendencies—holding yourself to very high standards and focusing on perceived mistakes. Have you noticed any particular thoughts that come up during these times?

[10:25] Alex: Yeah, I keep thinking, “I should have caught that bug earlier,” or “I’m not cut out for leadership.” It’s like a voice telling me I’m not good enough, even though I know I’m capable.

[10:30] Dr. Harper: Those are very common thoughts among high-achievers, especially after setbacks. Sometimes, these thoughts can become automatic and fuel anxiety and self-doubt. Would you be willing to try a cognitive restructuring exercise today to challenge some of these beliefs?

[10:35] Alex: Yeah, I’d like that. It’s just hard to shake off those feelings sometimes.

[10:40] Dr. Harper: Absolutely. Let’s start by identifying one of those thoughts. For example, “I’m not cut out for leadership.” Can we examine the evidence for and against that thought?

[10:45] Alex: Sure. Well, I have been promoted twice in the last year, and I’ve led several projects successfully. But I guess I still feel like I don’t have enough experience, especially after that failed launch.

[10:50] Dr. Harper: That’s a good observation. So, on one hand, your recent promotions and successful projects suggest you are capable. On the other, your feelings of inadequacy stem from that specific setback. How might you reframe the thought to reflect this evidence?

[10:55] Alex: Maybe I could think, “I’ve shown I can lead and learn from mistakes. One setback doesn’t define my abilities.”

[11:00] Dr. Harper: Exactly. That’s a more balanced perspective. Would you like to practice that reframing whenever similar thoughts arise?

[11:05] Alex: Yes, I think that could help. Sometimes I just get overwhelmed and forget to challenge those thoughts.

[11:10] Dr. Harper: That’s normal. We’ll work on building that habit over time. Now, earlier you mentioned wanting to develop healthier boundaries between work and personal life. Have you noticed any specific situations where boundaries get blurred?

[11:15] Alex: Yeah, I often check emails late at night or get tempted to continue working on side projects instead of relaxing. It’s like I feel guilty if I don’t stay productive.

[11:20] Dr. Harper: Guilt can be a strong motivator, but it can also contribute to burnout and anxiety. How do you feel about setting clear work hours and sticking to them?

[11:25] Alex: I know I should, but it’s hard. When I see an email or a new idea, I want to jump right into it. Sometimes I think if I don’t do it now, I’ll fall behind.

[11:30] Dr. Harper: That’s a common thought among perfectionists. Let’s explore a mindful exercise to help manage these impulses. Would you like to try a brief mindfulness practice now?

[11:35] Alex: Sure, I’m open to that.

(They proceed with a 3-minute guided mindfulness exercise focusing on observing thoughts and urges without acting on them immediately)

[11:40] Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that? Did anything come up for you?

[11:45] Alex: I noticed that the urge to check my phone or work was pretty strong, but just observing it made it feel a bit less intense. Like I didn’t have to react right away.

[11:50] Dr. Harper: That’s a great insight. Recognizing the urge without acting on it is a powerful step. Remember, it’s okay to take a pause and reflect before responding—this can help you build healthier habits over time.

[11:55] Alex: Yeah, I think I’ll try to remind myself of that next time I get caught up in work outside of hours.

[12:00] Dr. Harper: Perfect. Before we wrap up today, I’d like us to set a couple of small goals for the coming week. One could be practicing cognitive restructuring when you notice self-critical thoughts, and another might be implementing a specific boundary, like turning off work notifications after a certain time. Does that sound doable?

[12:05] Alex: Yes, I can do that. I’ll also try to track my thoughts and feelings using my mood app to see if I notice any patterns.

[12:10] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Tracking your thoughts and emotions will give us helpful data for future sessions. Next time, we can review your progress and explore any obstacles you encountered. How does that sound?

[12:15] Alex: Sounds good. Thanks, Harper. I appreciate the support and practical tools today.

[12:20] Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Alex. I’m glad we could make some progress today. Remember, change takes time, and every small step counts. See you next week!

[12:25] Alex: See you then. Have a good week!
