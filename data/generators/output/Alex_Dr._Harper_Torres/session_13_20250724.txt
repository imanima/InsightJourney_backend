[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:03] Alex: Hey, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. Work has been intense, but I’ve also started noticing some patterns around perfectionism that I want to dig into today.

[10:05] Dr. Harper: That’s great awareness. I remember last time we discussed how your perfectionism can sometimes lead to procrastination or feeling overwhelmed. Have you noticed specific triggers lately?

[10:07] Alex: Yeah, actually. Yesterday, I was working on a new feature, and I kept reworking the same screens because I thought they weren’t "good enough." It took me twice as long as I expected, and I started feeling really anxious about the launch.

[10:10] Dr. Harper: That sounds frustrating. When you say “not good enough,” what thoughts come up for you? Are there particular beliefs fueling that feeling?

[10:12] Alex: I guess I keep telling myself that if it’s not perfect, it’ll reflect badly on my skills. Like, I worry that if I ship something that’s just okay, people will think I’m a bad designer or I don’t know what I’m doing.

[10:15] Dr. Harper: That’s a common fear among high-achieving creatives. It sounds like you’re holding onto a core belief that your worth is tied to perfection or flawless work. Does that resonate?

[10:17] Alex: Yeah, definitely. I’ve always felt that way, but it’s worse after the launch failed. I keep thinking I should have known better or done more.

[10:20] Dr. Harper: It’s understandable to feel that way after a setback. Last time, we worked on recognizing these automatic thoughts. How did that go for you in practice?

[10:22] Alex: I tried catching myself when I started obsessing over details, but it’s still hard to stop the cycle once it’s started. The anxiety just kicks in.

[10:25] Dr. Harper: That’s expected. Cognitive restructuring takes time and practice. Let’s try a quick exercise now. Think of a recent situation where perfectionism triggered anxiety—like yesterday’s feature. Can you identify the thought that was most intense?

[10:27] Alex: Yeah, I kept thinking, “If I ship this, it’ll look like I’m not competent.”

[10:30] Dr. Harper: And what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that thought?

[10:32] Alex: Well, I guess I’ve shipped work before that wasn’t perfect, and no one has criticized me harshly. In fact, my team has been supportive.

[10:35] Dr. Harper: Excellent. So, the evidence suggests that shipping less-than-perfect work doesn’t necessarily mean you’re incompetent. How might you reframe that thought?

[10:37] Alex: Maybe I could think, “Shipping good enough is better than waiting for perfection, and it doesn’t mean I’m not capable.”

[10:40] Dr. Harper: That’s a strong reframe. How does it feel to hold that perspective?

[10:42] Alex: It feels a bit lighter, honestly. Like I’m giving myself permission to let go of some control.

[10:45] Dr. Harper: That’s a positive shift. Remember, perfectionism often stems from a fear of judgment or failure, but evidence shows that imperfection is part of growth. Now, how are you doing with your work-life boundaries? Any recent challenges there?

[10:47] Alex: Yeah, I’ve been working late more often, especially since the last launch. I tell myself I need the extra time to make everything perfect, but I’m exhausted.

[10:50] Dr. Harper: Recognizing that is a good first step. Have you tried any mindfulness or boundary-setting techniques since our last session?

[10:52] Alex: I’ve started a brief mindfulness practice in the morning, just five minutes of breathing, which helps. But setting boundaries at work is still tough—I find myself checking Slack after hours.

[10:55] Dr. Harper: That’s common, especially when you’re passionate about your work. Let’s explore a concrete plan. Could you set a specific “shutdown” time each evening? Perhaps 6:30 pm, with a ritual to disconnect, like turning off notifications or a short walk?

[10:57] Alex: Yeah, I could do that. I think part of my issue is that I feel guilty stopping early, like I’m leaving work unfinished.

[11:00] Dr. Harper: Guilt can be a barrier. Remember, setting boundaries is about protecting your well-being and sustainability. You can remind yourself that quality work often improves with rest and clear boundaries. How does that sound?

[11:02] Alex: It makes sense. I’ll try to implement the new routine starting tomorrow.

[11:05] Dr. Harper: Great. As homework, I’d like you to keep a brief journal of moments when you notice perfectionist thoughts or boundary challenges. Record the thought, evidence, and how you reframed it. We can review this next week.

[11:07] Alex: Sounds good. I’ll do that.

[11:10] Dr. Harper: Before we finish, I want to acknowledge your progress—recognizing triggers, reframing thoughts, and working on boundaries is significant work. How are you feeling about the overall process?

[11:12] Alex: Honestly, a bit more hopeful. It’s still hard, but I see that I can challenge some of these automatic beliefs and take small steps.

[11:15] Dr. Harper: That’s the essence of change. Small, consistent steps lead to lasting progress. Next session, we can review your journal and explore any new insights. Does that sound good?

[11:17] Alex: Yes, I look forward to it. Thanks, Harper.

[11:20] Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Alex. Take care until then, and remember to be gentle with yourself.
