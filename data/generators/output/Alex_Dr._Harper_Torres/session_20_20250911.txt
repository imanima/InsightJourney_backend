[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good morning! It's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:03] Alex: Hi, Harper. Thanks. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. The past week was tough with some new projects at work and feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been pretty anxious about meeting deadlines.

[10:06] Dr. Harper: That sounds challenging. When you say you're feeling anxious about deadlines, what specific thoughts come up for you?

[10:09] Alex: Well, I keep thinking that if I don’t get everything perfect, I’ll disappoint my team or look incompetent. I worry that my work isn’t good enough, and that I’ll be judged harshly.

[10:12] Dr. Harper: Those are quite intense worries. It sounds like there's a strong fear of not meeting expectations—both your own and others'. Do you notice any physical sensations or emotions accompanying those thoughts?

[10:15] Alex: Yeah, I get restless, my stomach knots up, and I feel a kind of pressure in my chest. Sometimes I get headaches too.

[10:18] Dr. Harper: Thanks for sharing that. It’s helpful to connect those thoughts with the physical responses. Last time, we talked about some core beliefs around perfectionism. How have you been reflecting on those since our last session?

[10:21] Alex: I’ve been trying to catch myself when I start spiraling into “I must be perfect” thoughts. But it’s hard to change that mindset overnight. I still feel like I need to prove myself constantly.

[10:24] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. Changing core beliefs takes time. Remember, in our previous sessions, we discussed evidence against some of those perfectionist thoughts. Have you noticed any instances where you thought you failed but actually succeeded?

[10:27] Alex: Actually, yes. The last project I launched had some bugs initially, but I fixed them quickly. My team appreciated the quick turnaround, but I kept focusing on the bugs instead of the success.

[10:30] Dr. Harper: That’s a great example of shifting perspective. It shows you’re capable of recognizing accomplishments even when issues arise. How did it feel to acknowledge that success?

[10:33] Alex: It felt a bit strange, honestly. Like I was giving myself credit I didn’t deserve. But I also felt a little more confident afterward.

[10:36] Dr. Harper: That’s a common reaction—self-criticism can be persistent. Let’s explore some cognitive restructuring techniques today to help reinforce those positive shifts. For example, when you notice yourself thinking “I’m not good enough,” we can practice challenging that thought.

[10:39] Alex: Yeah, I’d like that. Sometimes I just get stuck in that loop.

[10:42] Dr. Harper: Perfect. Let’s do a quick exercise now. Think of a recent situation where you felt imposter syndrome or perfectionism. Can you describe it?

[10:45] Alex: Sure. Last week, I was presenting a new feature idea to my team, and I kept thinking, “They’ll think this is terrible, and I’ll look incompetent.”

[10:48] Dr. Harper: Okay. Now, what’s the evidence that supports this thought? And what’s the evidence against it?

[10:51] Alex: Well, I did stumble over some parts of the presentation, so I guess that supports the “terrible idea” thought. But on the other hand, everyone seemed engaged, and my manager said it was a good presentation overall.

[10:54] Dr. Harper: Exactly. So, the evidence suggests that while you had a moment of uncertainty, the overall response was positive. How might you reframe that initial thought?

[10:57] Alex: Maybe I could think, “I had a rough moment, but my team responded well, and my ideas are valuable.”

[10:59] Dr. Harper: That’s a great reframe. Practice catching and challenging those automatic thoughts throughout your day. How does that feel?

[11:02] Alex: It feels a bit more manageable. Like I have some control over how I interpret things.

[11:05] Dr. Harper: That’s excellent progress. Now, earlier, you mentioned wanting to build confidence in your leadership. What small step could you take this week to reinforce that?

[11:08] Alex: Maybe I can volunteer to lead a small part of the next project or give feedback more assertively in team meetings.

[11:11] Dr. Harper: Those are excellent ideas. Taking small, manageable leadership roles can really boost your confidence. How do you feel about setting that as a goal?

[11:14] Alex: I like it. I think I can do that.

[11:17] Dr. Harper: Great. Also, let’s briefly touch on your work-life balance. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed. What boundaries have you tried to set recently?

[11:20] Alex: I’ve been trying to stop work by 6 PM, but I often end up checking emails after that or working late into the night.

[11:23] Dr. Harper: That’s common. Sometimes, the intention is there, but the habits need reinforcement. Maybe we can develop a specific evening routine to help disconnect, like a mindfulness practice or an activity you enjoy.

[11:26] Alex: Yeah, I’ve been wanting to start meditating again. Maybe I can do that right after work.

[11:29] Dr. Harper: That could work well. Even 5-10 minutes can make a difference in creating boundaries and reducing stress. Would you like some guided mindfulness exercises for next week?

[11:32] Alex: Yes, please. That sounds helpful.

[11:35] Dr. Harper: Perfect. To summarize today, we discussed your recent experiences with perfectionism and imposter syndrome, practiced cognitive restructuring, and set small leadership goals. You also identified a plan to incorporate mindfulness into your evening routine. How are you feeling about these next steps?

[11:38] Alex: I feel optimistic. It’s good to have some tools and ideas to work with. I know it’ll take time, but I’m ready to try.

[11:41] Dr. Harper: That’s a wonderful attitude. Remember, progress isn’t always linear. Be kind to yourself as you practice these skills. Before we finish, do you have any questions or anything else you want to share?

[11:44] Alex: Not right now. I think I just need to keep practicing what we talked about.

[11:47] Dr. Harper: Excellent. I’ll send you some resources on mindfulness and cognitive restructuring exercises. Next week, we can check in on how the leadership steps are going and explore any new challenges. Sound good?

[11:50] Alex: Sounds great. Thanks, Harper.

[11:52] Dr. Harper: You're welcome, Alex. Keep up the good work. See you next week.
