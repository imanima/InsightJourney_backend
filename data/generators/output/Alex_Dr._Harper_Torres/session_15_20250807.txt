[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, it’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:03] Alex: Hey, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel more confident, but then I get hit with waves of self-doubt, especially after that last project didn’t go as planned.

[10:07] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. It sounds like the recent launch shook your confidence a bit. Can you tell me more about what triggered those feelings of self-doubt?

[10:10] Alex: Yeah, I think it’s mainly the perfectionism I’ve been struggling with. I kept reviewing my designs obsessively, trying to catch every tiny mistake, and I still felt it wasn’t enough. When the launch failed, I just spiraled into thoughts like “I’m not good enough,” or “I don’t belong here.”

[10:13] Dr. Harper: It’s a common pattern, especially for someone with your perfectionist tendencies. Let’s explore those core beliefs a bit. Do you notice any recurring thoughts or beliefs about yourself when you’re working or after setbacks?

[10:16] Alex: I guess I often think, “If I don’t get everything perfect, I’m a failure.” Or, “I need to prove myself constantly, or I’ll be seen as inadequate.” Those kinds of thoughts come up a lot.

[10:19] Dr. Harper: Those are powerful beliefs. They can create a lot of pressure. Remember, in our previous sessions, we talked about how these core beliefs influence your reactions. How have you been applying the cognitive restructuring exercises we discussed?

[10:22] Alex: I’ve been trying to catch myself when those thoughts pop up. Sometimes I pause and challenge them—like asking, “Is this really true?” or “What’s the evidence for and against this?” It helps a bit, but it’s still hard to fully believe I’m enough, even when I know logically I am.

[10:25] Dr. Harper: That’s a good start. It’s normal for these thoughts to persist initially. Over time, with consistent practice, they tend to weaken. Have you noticed any specific situations recently that triggered these perfectionist or self-doubt feelings?

[10:28] Alex: Yeah, actually, yesterday I was presenting a new concept to my team, and I felt so anxious beforehand. I kept thinking I would mess up or that my ideas wouldn’t be good enough. I caught myself obsessing over tiny details in my slides, trying to make everything perfect.

[10:31] Dr. Harper: That’s a classic example. How did you manage your anxiety in that moment?

[10:34] Alex: I took a few deep breaths, tried to remind myself that I prepared well, but still, I felt my heart racing. After the presentation, though, I received some positive feedback, which helped a bit.

[10:37] Dr. Harper: That’s encouraging. It shows that your efforts to ground yourself and your skills are effective, even if only temporarily. How do you feel about your confidence level now, after that experience?

[10:40] Alex: Honestly, it’s mixed. Part of me feels proud for getting through it, but another part still worries I’ll stumble again or that I’m not good enough long-term.

[10:43] Dr. Harper: That’s very normal. Building confidence is a process, especially with perfectionism in the mix. Let’s revisit your goal of developing healthier work boundaries. Have you been able to set clearer limits around your work lately?

[10:46] Alex: I’ve tried, but I catch myself checking emails after hours or staying up late tweaking designs. I want to be more disciplined about work hours, but it’s hard to break the habit.

[10:49] Dr. Harper: It sounds like work is quite central to your identity, which makes setting boundaries challenging. We can incorporate some mindfulness practices to help you become more aware of those urges to overwork and respond differently. Would you like to try a quick mindfulness exercise now?

[10:52] Alex: Yeah, that sounds good. I could use it.

[10:55] Dr. Harper: Great. Let’s do a simple breathing exercise. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and focus on your breath—notice the inhale and exhale. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath. (Pause) We’ll do this for a couple of minutes. Ready?

[10:58] Alex: Okay, I’m ready.

(They proceed with the mindfulness exercise for two minutes.)

[11:00] Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?

[11:02] Alex: A bit calmer, I think. It’s easy to forget to pause and just breathe when I’m caught up in work stress.

[11:05] Dr. Harper: That’s an important insight. Incorporating brief mindfulness moments like this can help you notice those urges to overwork earlier, giving you space to choose a different response. Moving forward, we can work on creating specific, achievable boundaries and using these mindfulness techniques to reinforce them.

[11:08] Alex: Yeah, I like that idea. Sometimes I feel guilty stepping away, but I know I need to take care of myself too.

[11:10] Dr. Harper: Absolutely. Self-compassion is key here. Remember, taking breaks actually enhances your productivity and creativity. For next week, I’d like you to practice a 3-minute mindfulness breathing exercise daily and note any changes in your awareness around work boundaries.

[11:13] Alex: Will do. And I’ll keep challenging those negative thoughts about myself too.

[11:15] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Before we finish today, do you have any questions or anything else you’d like to discuss?

[11:17] Alex: Not right now. I think I’m starting to see some patterns more clearly, which is helpful.

[11:20] Dr. Harper: That’s wonderful progress, Alex. Remember, change takes time, and every step counts. Next week, we can explore some specific strategies for building confidence in your leadership role. Keep practicing your mindfulness, and I’ll see you then.

[11:23] Alex: Thanks, Harper. See you next week.

[11:25] Dr. Harper: Take care, Alex. Have a good week.
