[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:02] Alex: Hey, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve had some wins with managing my perfectionism at work, but I still find myself getting anxious about the next big project. It’s like I take two steps forward and one step back.

[10:05] Dr. Harper: That’s completely normal, especially when working on deep-rooted patterns like perfectionism. Remember, progress isn’t always linear. Last time, we talked about some of the triggers that lead to self-criticism. Have you noticed any new patterns or situations this week?

[10:07] Alex: Yes, actually. I was working on a presentation yesterday, and I kept obsessing over tiny details—font choices, color schemes—even though I’d already finished it. I started feeling this tightness in my chest, like I couldn’t breathe properly.

[10:09] Dr. Harper: That sounds like a classic anxiety response. Did you notice any thoughts running through your mind during that moment?

[10:11] Alex: Yeah, I kept thinking, “If I don’t get this perfect, I’ll look incompetent, and everyone will think I’m a failure.” It’s that fear of not being good enough, I guess.

[10:13] Dr. Harper: That’s an important insight—these core beliefs about competence and worth seem to be driving your perfectionism and anxiety. When you notice those thoughts, what do you usually tell yourself?

[10:15] Alex: Honestly, I try to push through and tell myself, “It’s okay, it’s just a project,” but that doesn’t always work. Sometimes, I get caught up in the “what if” scenarios—what if I mess up, what if I’m judged.”

[10:17] Dr. Harper: That’s very common. We’ve discussed before how cognitive restructuring can help challenge those “what if” thoughts. Have you had a chance to practice any of that outside our sessions?

[10:19] Alex: I did, actually. I started keeping a journal of my negative thoughts and then tried to find evidence against them. Like, I wrote down times when I submitted work that was well-received, even if it wasn’t perfect.

[10:21] Dr. Harper: That’s excellent. Evidence collection is a key part of CBT. How did that feel for you—seeing the evidence that contradicts your negative beliefs?

[10:23] Alex: It was eye-opening. It made me realize that my fear of failure is often exaggerated. Still, I notice those thoughts pop up all the time, especially when I’m under pressure.

[10:25] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. It’s important to remember that these thoughts are automatic and can be challenged. Moving forward, I’d like us to work on a specific exercise today—perhaps a mindfulness practice—to help you observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them.

[10:27] Alex: Yeah, I think that could help. Sometimes I get so caught up in the thinking that I forget to step back and breathe.

[10:29] Dr. Harper: Perfect. Let’s do a brief mindfulness exercise now. I want you to find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and focus on your breath. When thoughts come up—like about work or feeling inadequate—notice them without judgment and gently bring your focus back to your breath. Does that sound good?

[10:31] Alex: Yeah, I can do that.

(They proceed with the mindfulness exercise for a couple of minutes.)

[10:33] Dr. Harper: How did that feel?

[10:35] Alex: It was helpful. Just focusing on the breath made me realize how often my mind jumps ahead to worst-case scenarios.

[10:37] Dr. Harper: That’s a valuable observation. Part of what we’re working on is building that awareness so you can catch these thoughts earlier. Over time, this can help reduce the emotional charge they carry.

[10:39] Alex: Makes sense. I also wanted to mention that I’ve been trying to set clearer boundaries at work—like not checking emails after 6 PM—and it’s been somewhat easier.

[10:41] Dr. Harper: That’s great progress. Setting boundaries is crucial for managing stress and preventing burnout. How do you feel when you’re offline in the evenings?

[10:43] Alex: Honestly, a bit anxious at first—like I might miss something important—but then I remind myself that my work doesn’t define my worth. It’s a work in progress.

[10:45] Dr. Harper: Absolutely. Remember, building new habits takes time. You’re doing a lot of effective work already. Looking back over the past few months, how do you feel your confidence has shifted regarding your role and your work?

[10:47] Alex: I think I’ve become more aware of my perfectionist tendencies and started to challenge them. I still get anxious, but I’m better at catching the thoughts and not letting them control me.

[10:49] Dr. Harper: That’s a significant step. Recognizing the patterns is half the battle won. As we near the end of this session, I want us to set some specific goals for the next week. What’s one thing you want to focus on?

[10:51] Alex: I’d like to keep practicing mindfulness daily, especially before starting work or when I feel overwhelmed. Also, continue gathering evidence against my negative thoughts.

[10:53] Dr. Harper: Excellent. And I’d add—try to notice any physical sensations or emotional triggers that come up, and use your mindfulness to observe them without judgment. We’ll review your progress in our next session.

[10:55] Alex: Sounds good. Thanks, Harper. I feel like I’m making some solid progress, even if it’s slow.

[10:57] Dr. Harper: That’s the key—consistent effort. I’m proud of your work. See you next week, Alex.

[10:59] Alex: Thanks. Have a good week.
