[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good morning! It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  
(leans forward slightly, attentive)  

[10:05] Alex: Hi Dr. Torres. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling more anxious about my work, especially after that recent product launch. I keep replaying what I could have done differently.  

[10:10] Dr. Harper: That sounds really tough. It’s common to ruminate after a setback, especially when you’re a perfectionist. Can you tell me more about what thoughts come up when you think about the launch?  

[10:15] Alex: Yeah, I keep thinking, “I should have caught that mistake earlier,” or “I’m just not good enough to lead this team.” It feels like a constant voice of doubt.  

[10:20] Dr. Harper: Those thoughts seem quite harsh. Have you noticed any specific triggers that set off these feelings—like particular tasks or situations?  

[10:25] Alex: Definitely. Whenever I see feedback from stakeholders that’s critical, I get anxious. Also, when I compare my work to others’ on Twitch or design communities, I feel like I’m falling short.  

[10:30] Dr. Harper: That makes sense. It sounds like external feedback and comparison are significant triggers for you. Last time, we talked about the core belief, “I must be perfect to be valued.” Do you feel that’s still central for you?  

[10:35] Alex: Yeah, I think so. It’s like I tie my self-worth to how flawless my work is. When I mess up, it feels like I’m failing as a person.  

[10:40] Dr. Harper: That’s a very powerful belief. Let’s explore it a bit. When you think, “I must be perfect,” what evidence do you have that supports this? And what evidence might challenge it?  

[10:45] Alex: Well, I guess I’ve always been driven to do the best, but I’ve also failed before—like that launch. Still, I keep telling myself I should have done better. The evidence against it is that I’ve successfully led projects before, and I get positive feedback too.  

[10:50] Dr. Harper: Good insight. It seems like your past successes and feedback are evidence that you’re capable, even if recent setbacks feel overwhelming. How might you reframe the thought, “I must be perfect,” to something more balanced?  

[10:55] Alex: Maybe… “I strive for excellence, but it’s okay to make mistakes. They don’t define my worth.”  

[11:00] Dr. Harper: That’s a very healthy reframe. It acknowledges your high standards while allowing room for imperfection. Let’s practice a mindfulness exercise now to help you stay present when these thoughts arise. Would that be okay?  

[11:05] Alex: Yeah, sounds good.  

(Dr. Torres guides Alex through a brief mindfulness breathing exercise, focusing on observing thoughts without judgment.)  

[11:10] Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?  

[11:12] Alex: Already a bit calmer. It’s easier to see my thoughts as just thoughts, not facts.  

[11:15] Dr. Harper: Great. Remember, these skills can help you create some space between your thoughts and your reactions. Now, earlier you mentioned work-life balance. How’s that been going?  

[11:20] Alex: Honestly, I’ve been working late a lot, trying to fix things from the launch. I haven’t really set boundaries. It’s affecting my sleep and energy.  

[11:25] Dr. Harper: That’s a common pattern after a stressful event. Have you tried any specific strategies for setting boundaries or improving sleep hygiene?  

[11:30] Alex: I’ve been meaning to, but I haven’t stuck to a consistent schedule. I tend to check emails late at night or get into “just one more” design tweak.  

[11:35] Dr. Harper: That’s a good start noticing it. Let’s set some small, concrete goals for this week. For example, establishing a firm cutoff time for work and turning off notifications after 7 pm. Also, perhaps a calming bedtime routine?  

[11:40] Alex: Yeah, I think I can do that. Maybe I’ll try reading or meditating for 10 minutes before bed.  

[11:45] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Small, manageable steps are key. How about tracking your sleep quality and work boundaries using your app? That way, we can review your progress next session.  

[11:50] Alex: Sounds good. I’ll start logging those today.  

(They briefly review progress tracking tools and affirm the plan.)  

[11:55] Dr. Harper: To wrap up today, I want you to practice that mindfulness exercise whenever you notice anxious or critical thoughts, especially around work or social comparison. And remember, it’s okay to give yourself grace—perfection isn’t the goal, progress is.  

[12:00] Alex: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate the support and practical tools. I’ll work on those boundaries and try to be kinder to myself.  

[12:05] Dr. Harper: You’re doing great, Alex. Next session, we’ll review how these new strategies are working and explore any new challenges. Have a good week, and take care.  

[12:10] Alex: Thanks, you too. See you next week.
