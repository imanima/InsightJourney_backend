Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[10:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Alex, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable events or feelings you'd like to start with?

[10:05] Alex: Hi Dr. Torres. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The past week, I felt pretty anxious after that product launch didn’t go as planned. I keep replaying what I could have done differently, and it’s hard to shake off the doubts.

[10:10] Dr. Torres: That sounds tough. It’s understandable to feel that way after a setback, especially when you’re highly invested in your work. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts come up when you’re replaying the launch?

[10:15] Alex: Yeah, I keep thinking, “Maybe I’m not cut out for leadership,” or “My designs just aren’t good enough.” I notice that I get really critical of myself, and it spirals into feelings of imposter syndrome.

[10:20] Dr. Torres: Those are powerful core beliefs—"I'm not good enough" or "I don’t belong." It’s common to have these after setbacks, but they can really impact your confidence and anxiety. Last time, we discussed how perfectionism plays into this. Have you noticed any patterns in your work where this perfectionism shows up?

[10:25] Alex: Definitely. I tend to obsess over tiny details, even when I know I should move on. Like, last week, I spent hours tweaking a button in a prototype just because I thought it wasn’t perfect yet. It’s like I get stuck in this loop of trying to perfect everything.

[10:30] Dr. Torres: That’s a classic perfectionist pattern. Sometimes, our desire for perfection can be a barrier to progress and can amplify anxiety when things don’t meet our high standards. Based on your example, how did that impact your overall workload or mood?

[10:35] Alex: It made me feel overwhelmed, like I was never going to finish anything. I also felt frustrated with myself for wasting so much time on small stuff. It’s like I can’t let go of control.

[10:40] Dr. Torres: That’s insightful. It sounds like the perfectionism is fueling the anxiety and making it harder to complete tasks. Last time, we worked on cognitive restructuring to challenge some of these perfectionist thoughts. Have you tried any of those techniques this week?

[10:45] Alex: I did. I caught myself thinking, “If I don’t get this perfect, I’ll fail,” and I challenged it by asking, “What’s the evidence for and against this?” I realized that even if something isn’t perfect, it can still be valuable and effective.

[10:50] Dr. Torres: That’s a great step forward. Challenging those all-or-nothing thoughts helps to create a more balanced perspective. Did you notice any change in how you felt afterward?

[10:55] Alex: I felt a bit calmer, but the underlying perfectionism is still there. It’s like an ingrained habit that takes time to shift.

[11:00] Dr. Torres: Absolutely, change takes consistent effort. Remember, progress is often about small wins. You’re already doing well by catching these thoughts and questioning them. Have you also been practicing mindfulness or any relaxation techniques?

[11:05] Alex: Yes, I started doing a 5-minute breathing exercise in the mornings. It helps me start the day with a bit more clarity, but I sometimes forget when I get busy.

[11:10] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. Consistency is key. Perhaps integrating mindfulness into your routine at specific times, like before work or during breaks, might help reinforce it. Also, considering your work on work-life boundaries, how are you feeling about balancing your design projects and personal time?

[11:15] Alex: Honestly, it’s still a struggle. I tend to work late into the night, especially when I feel behind. It’s like I’m afraid if I stop, I’ll lose control or fall behind others.

[11:20] Dr. Torres: That fear of losing control is common among perfectionists and high-achievers. It’s important to recognize that rest and boundaries are essential for sustained performance and well-being. Let’s explore some strategies to help you set healthier boundaries. Have you tried scheduling specific work hours and sticking to them?

[11:25] Alex: I’ve started doing that, but I often find myself working past those hours because I think I need to finish things or fix mistakes.

[11:30] Dr. Torres: That’s understandable. An effective approach is to use a timer or alarms to signal when your workday ends. Also, practicing a brief mindfulness exercise at the end of your workday can help you transition into personal time. How does that sound?

[11:35] Alex: That sounds helpful. I think I need to get better at disconnecting, especially since I often feel guilty about taking breaks.

[11:40] Dr. Torres: Guilt around taking time off is quite common, but it’s important to challenge that belief. Rest is part of the productivity cycle. As a next step, I’d like you to try setting a firm work boundary this week—say, no work after 6 pm—and practice a mindfulness exercise at the end of your workday. How does that feel?

[11:45] Alex: It feels doable. I’ll give it a try. I think it’ll help me feel more in control and less anxious about work piling up.

[11:50] Dr. Torres: Great. And remember, it’s okay to start small. We’ll review how it goes in our next session. Before we wrap up today, I want to acknowledge your efforts in challenging your perfectionist thoughts and working on boundaries. That’s significant progress.

[11:55] Alex: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate the support. It’s encouraging to see the small changes adding up.

[12:00] Dr. Torres: Excellent. So, to summarize, your action items are: continue practicing cognitive restructuring when perfectionist thoughts arise, implement your new boundary-setting plan, and integrate mindfulness into your daily routine. Next week, we can review how these strategies worked and explore any new challenges. Does that sound good?

[12:05] Alex: Yes, that works for me. Thanks again for today.

[12:10] Dr. Torres: You’re welcome, Alex. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Have a great rest of your day.
