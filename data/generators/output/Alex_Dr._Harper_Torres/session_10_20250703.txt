[10:00] Dr. Torres: Hi Alex, it’s good to see you again. How are you feeling today?  
[10:02] Alex: Hey, Dr. Torres. Honestly, I’ve been a bit overwhelmed this past week. Work’s been intense, and I’ve been obsessing over some recent feedback from that last project.  
[10:04] Dr. Torres: That sounds tough. Do you want to tell me more about what’s been going on with the feedback?  
[10:07] Alex: Yeah, well, I launched that new feature last week, and initially, I thought it was solid. But then my manager pointed out some areas for improvement, and I just spiraled—started doubting everything I did, even though I know logically it was a good effort.  
[10:09] Dr. Torres: It sounds like the feedback triggered some self-doubt and perfectionism. When you say you spiraled, what kind of thoughts or feelings were coming up?  
[10:11] Alex: Mostly, I kept thinking I’m not good enough, that I messed up big time, and maybe I don’t belong here. I felt anxious and kind of ashamed.  
[10:14] Dr. Torres: That’s quite common after setbacks, especially when you’re perfectionistic. Remember last time, we talked about how core beliefs about being “not good enough” can influence these reactions. Do you see how that might be affecting your response now?  
[10:16] Alex: Yeah, I guess I do. It’s like I have this inner critic that’s always ready to point out flaws. But I also notice that I get stuck ruminating on what I could have done better, to the point where I’m paralyzed.  
[10:19] Dr. Torres: That’s a very insightful observation. Rumination can definitely keep you stuck. Have you been practicing the mindfulness exercises we discussed?  
[10:22] Alex: I’ve tried, yeah. I’ve been doing the breathing exercises before bed, and sometimes I pause during the day to ground myself. It helps a little, but the anxious thoughts about work still pop up.  
[10:25] Dr. Torres: That’s progress. Mindfulness isn’t about eliminating thoughts but observing them without judgment. When those anxious thoughts about your work come up, what do you tell yourself?  
[10:27] Alex: I usually tell myself, “You should have done better,” or “You’re a failure,” which just makes things worse.  
[10:29] Dr. Torres: That self-critical inner voice is very common. Remember, part of cognitive restructuring involves challenging those automatic thoughts. Can we work together now to reframe some of those?  
[10:31] Alex: Sure, I’d like that.  
[10:33] Dr. Torres: Great. Let’s take the thought, “I’m a failure,” and examine the evidence for and against it. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?  
[10:36] Alex: Well, I did get negative feedback, and I’ve made mistakes before. Maybe I am failing.  
[10:38] Dr. Torres: And what evidence contradicts it?  
[10:40] Alex: I also received positive feedback earlier in the project, and I’ve successfully launched several features before. Plus, the feedback was specific, and I know I can improve.  
[10:42] Dr. Torres: Exactly. So, a more balanced thought might be, “I received some critical feedback, but I’ve also had successes, and I’m capable of learning and improving.” How does that feel?  
[10:45] Alex: It feels more realistic, but part of me still feels anxious.  
[10:47] Dr. Torres: That’s normal. Anxiety often persists even with balanced thoughts. That’s where mindfulness and exposure can help. For example, gradually exposing yourself to situations that trigger perfectionism—like sharing drafts earlier or setting more achievable standards—can build confidence.  
[10:50] Alex: I think I’ve been avoiding sharing work early because I worry it’s not perfect. Maybe that’s making things worse because I never get feedback that could help me improve sooner.  
[10:53] Dr. Torres: That’s an excellent insight. Building trust in your process and setting incremental goals for sharing work could be beneficial. How about we create a plan to practice this?  
[10:55] Alex: Yeah, I’d like that. Maybe I can share a rough version of my next design with my team, even if I feel it’s not perfect.  
[10:57] Dr. Torres: That sounds like a good step. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. For next week, let’s also revisit your sleep habits—since we know fatigue can amplify perfectionism and anxiety. Have you been keeping up with your sleep hygiene routine?  
[11:00] Alex: I’ve been trying to stick to a regular schedule, but late nights working on design sometimes throw me off.  
[11:02] Dr. Torres: Consistency is key. Do you want to identify specific adjustments you can make to support better sleep?  
[11:04] Alex: Maybe setting a firm cutoff time for work, like 7 PM, and sticking to it. Also, avoiding screens an hour before bed.  
[11:07] Dr. Torres: Those are excellent strategies. Implementing them alongside your mindfulness practice can help improve your overall resilience to stress.  
[11:09] Alex: Makes sense. I think I feel a bit more hopeful now. It’s reassuring to have some concrete steps.  
[11:11] Dr. Torres: That’s great. Before we wrap up, let’s set some specific goals for next week. How about: 1) Practice sharing a rough draft of your design with your team, and 2) implement your new sleep routine consistently.  
[11:14] Alex: Sounds good. I’ll give it a try.  
[11:16] Dr. Torres: Excellent. And remember, if you notice any particularly challenging thoughts or feelings, jot them down to discuss next time. We’re making steady progress.  
[11:18] Alex: Thanks, Dr. Torres. I appreciate your support.  
[11:20] Dr. Torres: You’re very welcome, Alex. Looking forward to hearing how it goes next week. Have a great rest of your day.
