Professional: Dr. Harper Torres (Licensed Clinical Psychologist)

[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Good morning, Alex. It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:03] Alex: Hey, Harper. Honestly, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. The launch I worked on failed last week, and I’ve been stuck in this loop of self-doubt. It’s like I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not good enough.

[10:06] Dr. Harper: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way after a setback. Do you notice any particular thoughts or beliefs that come up when you're feeling this way?

[10:09] Alex: Yeah, I keep thinking, “I’m just not cut out for this,” or “Everyone else is better than me.” I guess I’m questioning if I really belong in this role.

[10:12] Dr. Harper: Those are strong core beliefs you're describing—feelings of inadequacy and imposter syndrome. Remember, in past sessions, we discussed how perfectionism can sometimes fuel these thoughts. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that tend to bring up these feelings?

[10:15] Alex: Definitely. Whenever I get negative feedback, even if it’s constructive, I immediately go to that place. Also, when I see other designers sharing their work on social media, I feel like I’m falling behind.

[10:18] Dr. Harper: That’s a common trigger—comparing yourself to others. It’s important to recognize that social media often shows curated highlights. We can work on cognitive restructuring around these comparisons. But first, how are you managing sleep and daily routines these days?

[10:21] Alex: Honestly, not great. I’ve been staying up later, ruminating about the launch, and waking up feeling exhausted. It’s like my anxiety is messing with my sleep cycle.

[10:24] Dr. Harper: Sleep hygiene is crucial for managing anxiety and mood. We can revisit some routines today. But circling back, when you think about your work and the recent setback, what evidence do you have that contradicts these negative beliefs about your abilities?

[10:27] Alex: Well, I did get positive feedback on some parts of the project initially. And I’ve successfully led projects before, so I know I can do good work.

[10:30] Dr. Harper: Exactly. Those are important pieces of evidence. Sometimes, our minds focus on the negatives and overlook the positives. Let’s try a cognitive restructuring exercise. Can you list some of your strengths as a designer and a professional?

[10:33] Alex: Hmm, I’m detail-oriented, creative, and I’ve been told I’m good at solving complex problems. Also, I’m persistent—I don’t give up easily.

[10:36] Dr. Harper: Those are significant strengths. When negative thoughts like “I’m not good enough” arise, try to counter them with these facts. For example, “I’ve successfully handled difficult projects before, and my strengths have helped me get through challenges.” How does that feel?

[10:39] Alex: It makes sense, but sometimes it’s hard to believe it in the moment. I guess I need to practice more.

[10:42] Dr. Harper: Exactly, it’s about building that cognitive flexibility. Now, regarding your perfectionism, have you noticed any specific behaviors that keep this going? For example, over-editing your work or delaying releases?

[10:45] Alex: Yeah, I tend to obsess over every detail, even when I know it’s “good enough,” I keep tweaking it. It’s like I can’t let go.

[10:48] Dr. Harper: That’s a common perfectionist pattern. Sometimes, setting time limits or defining “good enough” thresholds can help. We can develop a plan to practice this. Also, how are you feeling about your work-life balance lately?

[10:51] Alex: Not great. I often work late into the night, and I don’t really disconnect. It feels like if I don’t, I’ll fall behind or disappoint my team.

[10:54] Dr. Harper: Maintaining boundaries is essential, especially to reduce burnout and anxiety. We’ve talked before about mindfulness as a tool—would you like to try a brief mindfulness exercise now to help ground you?

[10:57] Alex: Yeah, I’d like that.

[10:59] Dr. Harper: Great. Let’s do a quick breathing exercise. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and focus on your breath—inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a moment, then exhale through your mouth. Notice the sensation of the air. Whenever your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breathing. We’ll do this for about a minute.

(Brief pause as Alex follows the exercise)

[11:00] Dr. Harper: How do you feel now?

[11:02] Alex: A little calmer. I think I needed that to reset a bit.

[11:04] Dr. Harper: That’s wonderful. Regular mindfulness practice can help manage anxiety and improve focus. Now, looking ahead, what specific steps would you like to take before our next session?

[11:07] Alex: I want to work on challenging my negative thoughts daily, especially when I catch myself comparing or doubting. Also, I’ll try to set a strict cutoff time for work each evening and stick to it.

[11:10] Dr. Harper: Those are excellent goals. Remember to use your strengths—your detail-orientation and persistence—to implement these changes. We’ll track your progress using your mood and sleep app. Next time, we can review how these strategies are working and adjust as needed.

[11:12] Alex: Sounds good. Thanks, Harper. I already feel a bit more hopeful just talking about this.

[11:15] Dr. Harper: I’m glad to hear that, Alex. You’re making meaningful progress. Let’s continue building on this next week. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything urgent comes up.

[11:17] Alex: Will do. Thanks again. See you next week.

[11:20] Dr. Harper: Take care.
