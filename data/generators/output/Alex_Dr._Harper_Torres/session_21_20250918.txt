[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good morning! It's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:03] Alex: Hi Dr. Torres. Honestly, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve been feeling more anxious about the upcoming product launch, but I also managed to set some boundaries with work last week, so that was a win.

[10:05] Dr. Torres: That's great to hear about the boundaries—that's often a tough skill to develop. Can you tell me more about what triggered your anxiety around the launch?

[10:08] Alex: Sure. I think it’s mostly the fear of not being perfect enough. I keep replaying the last launch where I felt I didn’t meet expectations, and I worry I’ll mess up again or that people will see me as incompetent.

[10:10] Dr. Torres: It sounds like perfectionism and fear of judgment are playing significant roles here. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up when you're feeling anxious about the launch?

[10:12] Alex: Yeah, I often think, “If I don’t do this perfectly, I’ll disappoint everyone,” or “They’ll think I’m not capable.” It’s like this voice that’s always critical.

[10:15] Dr. Torres: That internal voice can be quite harsh. It’s a common pattern, especially for high-achievers like yourself. Last time, we talked about examining these thoughts. Do you remember the cognitive restructuring exercise we did?

[10:17] Alex: Yes, I remember. We looked at evidence for and against those thoughts. I think I did okay with that, but I still feel the anxiety.

[10:20] Dr. Torres: That’s normal. Changing thought patterns takes practice. Let’s revisit that now. Can you share one of those automatic thoughts you had recently?

[10:22] Alex: Sure. One was, “If I don’t nail this presentation, it’s a total failure.”

[10:25] Dr. Torres: Okay. So, what evidence do you have that supports this thought? And what evidence contradicts it?

[10:27] Alex: Well, I do sometimes stumble over words, but I’ve also had presentations where I received positive feedback, even when I felt I wasn’t perfect.

[10:30] Dr. Torres: That’s a good start. It seems like the thought might be a bit all-or-nothing. Perhaps, we could reframe it to something like, “Even if I make mistakes, I can still deliver a valuable presentation.” How does that feel?

[10:33] Alex: Yeah, I think that’s more realistic. It helps to see that mistakes are part of learning, not a complete failure.

[10:35] Dr. Torres: Exactly. Recognizing that can reduce some of the pressure. Now, you mentioned last time you’ve been working on setting boundaries. How has that been going?

[10:38] Alex: Better, actually. I blocked out specific times for focused work and made sure to step away after hours. It’s been helpful, but I sometimes catch myself checking email late at night.

[10:40] Dr. Torres: That’s common, especially when we’re trying to change habits. Have you considered mindfulness or a sleep hygiene routine to help disconnect?

[10:43] Alex: I’ve tried a few mindfulness exercises, but I find my mind still races. Sleep has been okay, but I know I could improve.

[10:45] Dr. Torres: Mindfulness takes time to develop, so that’s normal. For sleep, have you been tracking your sleep patterns? Remember, integrating sleep hygiene practices like avoiding screens before bed and maintaining a consistent schedule can make a difference.

[10:48] Alex: I do use a sleep tracker, and I’ve noticed I often wake up anxious in the middle of the night, especially when I’m stressed about work.

[10:50] Dr. Torres: That’s insightful. Waking up anxious can perpetuate the cycle. We can explore some techniques to manage nighttime worry, like a brief journaling routine before bed or a calming mindfulness exercise.

[10:53] Alex: That sounds helpful. I think I’d like to try journaling to get some of those racing thoughts out.

[10:55] Dr. Torres: Great. Now, stepping back a bit, how do you feel about your progress over the past few months? We’ve been working on perfectionism, managing anxiety, and setting boundaries.

[10:58] Alex: I think I’ve made some good strides. I’m more aware of my thoughts and how they influence my feelings. Setting boundaries has been easier, and I’m trying to be kinder to myself.

[11:00] Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful progress, Alex. Remember, change is gradual, and setbacks are normal. The key is consistency. For our next steps, I’d like you to practice the cognitive restructuring we've discussed whenever you notice those perfectionistic thoughts, and try the journaling routine before bed. Also, continue tracking your sleep and anxiety levels with your app.

[11:03] Alex: Will do. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel more equipped to handle these challenges now.

[11:05] Dr. Torres: Excellent. Keep noting your experiences, and we’ll review your progress next week. How does that sound?

[11:07] Alex: Sounds good. Thanks again for your support.

[11:09] Dr. Torres: You're welcome. Have a great week, Alex, and remember to be gentle with yourself. See you next week!

[11:10] End of session.
