**[10:00]**  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Alex: Hey, Harper. Um, honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel okay, and others I’m right back into that perfectionist spiral, especially with work.  

Dr. Harper: That sounds challenging. Would you like to tell me more about what’s been triggering those moments?  

Alex: Yeah, I think it’s mainly when I launch new design features. If I don’t get everything perfect or if I hear one critique—like on Twitch or from my team—I start doubting myself. It’s like I forget all the good feedback I’ve had.  

[10:10]  
Dr. Harper: That’s a common experience with perfectionism—getting caught up in the details and losing sight of the progress you’ve made. Do you notice particular thoughts that come up during those times?  

Alex: Yeah, I catch myself thinking, “I’m not good enough,” or “I should have known better,” especially after a launch that doesn’t go as planned. It’s like I’m punishing myself.  

Dr. Harper: Those are quite harsh beliefs. Let’s explore where they might be coming from. Do you remember when you first started feeling this pressure to be perfect?  

Alex: Hmm, I think it ties back to when I was in school. I was always told to excel, and I guess I internalized that. Now, it’s like I’m still chasing that perfection to prove I’m worth it.  

[10:20]  
Dr. Harper: That makes sense. It sounds like a core belief that your worth depends on flawless work. Have you noticed how that belief influences your current feelings and behaviors?  

Alex: Yeah, it makes me anxious, especially when I’m about to present or launch something new. I get this fear of failure, and it stops me from taking risks sometimes.  

Dr. Harper: That fear of failure is very common. We can work on cognitive restructuring to challenge those automatic thoughts. For instance, what’s the evidence that supports or contradicts “I’m not good enough”?  

Alex: Well, I have a portfolio full of successful projects, and I’ve received praise from colleagues. But then I think, “That was just luck,” or “They’re just being nice.”  

Dr. Harper: That’s an important insight. It sounds like you’re discounting your achievements. Would you be willing to try a thought challenge? For example, replacing “I’m not good enough” with “My successes show I am capable”?  

Alex: Yeah, I think I can try that. It’s hard, but I see how it might help.  

[10:30]  
Dr. Harper: Great. Let’s also incorporate mindfulness to observe these thoughts without judgment. Maybe a quick breathing exercise now?  

Alex: Sure.  

(They briefly do a mindfulness breathing exercise.)  

Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?  

Alex: A bit calmer. It’s like I can pause before spiraling.  

Dr. Harper: Exactly. That pause can be powerful in breaking the cycle. Over time, it can help you respond differently to those triggers.  

[10:40]**  
Dr. Harper: Let’s revisit your goals. You mentioned wanting to build confidence and manage perfectionism. Have you noticed any small wins or progress since our last session?  

Alex: Actually, yeah. Last week, I intentionally set a boundary by leaving work at 6 PM, even though I felt guilty. I also shared some of my doubts with a teammate, and they responded supportively.  

Dr. Harper: That’s excellent progress, Alex. It shows you’re experimenting with healthier boundaries and opening up rather than bottling things up. How did that feel?  

Alex: Honestly, a bit scary but also relieving. It’s like I’m starting to see that I don’t have to do everything perfectly or handle everything alone.  

Dr. Harper: That’s a big step. Building confidence often involves these small, consistent actions. Would you like to set a specific goal for the next week?  

Alex: Yeah, I want to practice catching those perfectionist thoughts during work and challenge them with evidence. Also, I’ll try to do the mindfulness exercise daily.  

Dr. Harper: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Keep track of these moments—maybe using your progress app—to see how your confidence grows over time.  

[10:50]**  
Dr. Harper: Before we finish, is there anything else you want to talk about today?  

Alex: I guess I just want to say I appreciate these sessions. They help me see my patterns more clearly. Sometimes I forget that progress is possible.  

Dr. Harper: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, setbacks are part of growth. The key is staying committed to your goals. Next week, we can review how your thought-challenging and mindfulness practice went.  

Alex: Sounds good. Thanks, Harper.  

Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Alex. See you next week.
