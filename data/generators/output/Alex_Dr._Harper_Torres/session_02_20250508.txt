**[10:00]**  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Any notable changes or reflections over the week?  

**[10:05]**  
Alex: Hey, thanks. Overall, I think I’m doing okay. I’ve been trying to pay more attention to my thoughts around perfectionism, especially when I’m working late on a project. But honestly, I still catch myself spiraling into self-criticism pretty often.  

Dr. Harper: That’s a great awareness to have, Alex. Recognizing those moments is half the battle. Can you tell me about a specific time this week when you noticed that perfectionist voice popping up?  

**[10:10]**  
Alex: Yeah, yesterday I was refining a design for our app. I kept tweaking tiny details — like the spacing and colors — even though my team already approved it. I felt anxious that if I didn’t get everything perfect, it would reflect badly on my skills.  

Dr. Harper: It sounds like that urge to perfect every detail is pretty strong. When you notice that happening, what do you usually tell yourself?  

Alex: I guess I think, “If I don’t get this right, I’ll be seen as incompetent,” or “I need to do more to prove myself.”  

Dr. Harper: Those are insightful observations. That belief—that you need to be perfect to be valued or competent—seems to be a core part of your perfectionism. Does that resonate with you?  

Alex: Yeah, definitely. It’s like I’m constantly trying to prove myself, and nothing feels enough.  

**[10:15]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s very common among high-achievers. And it’s important to recognize that these beliefs—like “I need to be perfect”—are often exaggerated or unhelpful. We can work on challenging that by collecting evidence against these thoughts. For example, what’s an example from your work where you delivered something that was good enough, even if it wasn’t perfect?  

Alex: Well, last month, I led a presentation for a new feature. It wasn’t perfect—there were some slides I wish I had more time to improve—but my team told me it was clear and well-received. I guess I didn’t really see it that way at the time.  

Dr. Harper: That’s a great example. Your team’s feedback suggests that even with imperfections, your work was effective and appreciated. When you think about that, how does it challenge your “must be perfect” belief?  

Alex: I suppose it shows that my work can be valuable even if it’s not flawless. But I still feel that urge to make everything perfect, especially when I’m anxious about future projects.  

**[10:20]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. It’s a process to loosen the grip of perfectionism. We can try a cognitive restructuring technique called “evidence collection.” Next time you notice that urge, I want you to ask, “What evidence do I have that I’m not good enough?” and then list the evidence that supports or contradicts that. Would you be willing to try that?  

Alex: Yeah, I can do that. It might help to see things more clearly rather than just spiraling in my head.  

Dr. Harper: Excellent. Also, you mentioned in our previous session that work-life balance has been hard to maintain. Have you been able to implement any strategies to set boundaries?  

**[10:25]**  
Alex: I’ve tried to stick to my scheduled work hours more strictly, especially not working past 6 PM. But I find myself checking emails or design ideas after hours anyway. I feel guilty if I don’t, like I’m slacking off.  

Dr. Harper: That guilt is a common feeling when trying to establish boundaries. Sometimes, the shame or guilt comes from our core beliefs about worthiness. Let’s explore your self-worth—what do you believe about your value outside of work achievements?  

Alex: Hmm, I guess I often tie my value to how well I perform or how much I accomplish. If I’m not busy or producing, I feel like I’m not contributing enough.  

Dr. Harper: That’s a very common belief, especially in high-achieving environments. We can work on developing a more balanced self-view that isn’t solely dependent on productivity. One way is to practice mindfulness around self-compassion—reminding yourself that your worth isn’t conditional on work. Would you be interested in trying a short mindfulness exercise now?  

Alex: Yeah, I’d like that.  

**[10:30]**  
Dr. Harper: Great. I’ll guide you through a simple self-compassion mindfulness. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. As you breathe, silently repeat to yourself, “I am enough just as I am,” acknowledging any feelings that come up without judgment. Focus on the sensation of your breath and this affirmation.  

(Pause for a brief mindfulness exercise)  

How do you feel after that?  

Alex: I feel a bit calmer, more grounded. It’s strange how just saying those words makes me realize I’ve been so hard on myself.  

Dr. Harper: That’s a powerful insight. Regular practice can help reinforce this compassionate perspective. Over time, it can support you in setting healthier boundaries without the guilt.  

**[10:35]**  
Alex: Yeah, I want to work on that. It’s just tough to change how I see myself sometimes.  

Dr. Harper: Absolutely. Change takes time, and it’s a gradual process. We’ll keep working on these core beliefs and develop some specific goals over the next few sessions. Speaking of goals, how are you feeling about your progress with building confidence in your leadership role?  

Alex: Honestly, I think I’m starting to see that I don’t need to be perfect to be a good leader. I’ve been trying to delegate more and trust my team. It’s still hard, but I notice I’m less anxious about every detail now.  

Dr. Harper: That’s wonderful progress. Recognizing that trust and delegation are signs of leadership growth. It’s also a way to combat the perfectionism that can be paralyzing. Let’s continue to track these wins and build on them.  

**[10:40]**  
Alex: Sounds good. I’ll keep practicing the evidence gathering and mindfulness. I think it’s helping me feel more in control.  

Dr. Harper: Excellent, Alex. As a next step, I’d like you to keep a brief journal of moments when you notice perfectionist thoughts or feelings of guilt about boundaries. We’ll review these in our next session to identify patterns and celebrate your successes.  

Alex: I can do that. Thanks, Harper.  

Dr. Harper: You’re very welcome. Remember, progress isn’t linear, but every step counts. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week.  

**[10:45]**  
Alex: Thanks again. See you next week.  

Dr. Harper: Take care, Alex. Have a good rest of your day.
