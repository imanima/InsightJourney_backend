**[10:00]**  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good morning! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**[10:02]**  
Alex: Hi, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The past week, I felt pretty anxious after that launch failed. I kept obsessing over what I could have done differently.  

**[10:05]**  
Dr. Harper: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way after a setback, especially when you’re used to high standards. Did you notice any specific triggers that made those feelings worse?  

**[10:07]**  
Alex: Yeah, I think it was mainly when I saw comments from the community—or when I checked my Twitch stream stats. The low viewer count, for example, made me question if I’m really good enough.  

**[10:09]**  
Dr. Harper: It sounds like those external markers—comments, stats—are feeding into your self-critical thoughts. Have you noticed what core beliefs come up for you during those moments?  

**[10:11]**  
Alex: I guess I start thinking I’m a failure or that I’m not talented enough to be a leader in my field. That I don’t really belong in the design community at this level.  

**[10:13]**  
Dr. Harper: Those are powerful beliefs. And they’re quite common among perfectionists—feeling like you need to be perfect or else you’re not enough. Let’s try a quick exercise: can you recall a recent instance where you felt this way and see if we can identify the evidence for and against those beliefs?  

**[10:15]**  
Alex: Sure. Well, after the launch, I kept replaying all my mistakes—missing a deadline here, a design element that didn’t work there. But, honestly, I also received some positive feedback from my manager, and some users said they liked certain features.  

**[10:17]**  
Dr. Harper: Excellent observation. So, while your mind was focusing on the negatives, there was also evidence of success and competence. This is a good example of cognitive restructuring—challenging the all-or-nothing thinking. How does it feel to see both sides?  

**[10:19]**  
Alex: It’s a bit eye-opening. I guess I tend to focus only on the negatives, which makes me doubt myself even more.  

**[10:21]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a common pattern. Over time, we can work on shifting that focus and developing a more balanced view. Now, earlier you mentioned perfectionism—how do you think it’s impacting your work and your sense of confidence?  

**[10:23]**  
Alex: I think it’s both motivating and paralyzing. I want to do everything perfectly, but that makes me afraid to take risks or even share drafts, which delays projects and makes me doubt whether I’m good enough to lead.  

**[10:25]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a classic perfectionism trap. Sometimes, aiming for excellence can help, but when it causes procrastination or self-criticism, it becomes counterproductive. Have you tried any strategies to manage these perfectionist tendencies?  

**[10:27]**  
Alex: I’ve started setting more realistic goals—for example, aiming for “good enough” rather than perfect. Also, I’ve been trying to remind myself that iteration is part of the process. But I still struggle with letting go of control.  

**[10:29]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a meaningful step. Let’s build on that. One technique we can explore is mindfulness to observe these perfectionist urges without immediately reacting to them. Would you like to do a brief mindfulness exercise now?  

**[10:31]**  
Alex: Yeah, I’d like that.  

**[10:33]**  
Dr. Harper: Great. I’ll guide you. Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes if you feel comfortable, and take a few deep breaths. As you breathe in and out, notice any thoughts or feelings about your work, especially those perfectionism or self-doubt thoughts. Just observe them without judgment. When you notice your mind wandering, gently bring your focus back to your breath.  

( pauses for a minute )  

How was that?  

**[10:34]**  
Alex: It was helpful. I noticed that even just paying attention to my breath made me more aware of how often I judge myself harshly.  

**[10:36]**  
Dr. Harper: That awareness is a key step. When you notice those perfectionist thoughts, try to see them as just thoughts—temporary mental events—not facts. Over time, this can reduce their power. Now, thinking ahead, how might you incorporate this mindfulness into your daily routine?  

**[10:38]**  
Alex: I could do a quick breathing exercise before starting work or when I catch myself obsessing over small details. Maybe even during breaks.  

**[10:40]**  
Dr. Harper: That sounds like a solid plan. Also, I’d encourage you to keep using your progress tracker—note when you recognize these thoughts and how you respond. This helps reinforce new patterns.  

**[10:42]**  
Alex: Yeah, I’ve been using an app for that. It’s interesting to see the patterns over time.  

**[10:44]**  
Dr. Harper: Perfect. Tracking progress is a core part of CBT, and it’ll help you see your growth. Before we wrap up today, let’s set some specific goals for the next week. What’s one thing you want to focus on?  

**[10:46]**  
Alex: I want to challenge my all-or-nothing thinking more consciously—especially when I catch myself thinking I have to be perfect. I’ll try to reframe those thoughts with evidence, like we practiced.  

**[10:48]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a great goal. And remember, progress isn’t linear—be gentle with yourself. Next time, we can review how that went and explore any new triggers. Any questions or thoughts before we finish?  

**[10:50]**  
Alex: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I already feel a bit more grounded.  

**[10:52]**  
Dr. Harper: I’m glad to hear that, Alex. You’re making meaningful strides. I’ll see you next week, and in the meantime, keep practicing the mindfulness and reframing techniques. Have a good week!  

**[10:54]**  
Alex: Thanks, you too. Bye!
