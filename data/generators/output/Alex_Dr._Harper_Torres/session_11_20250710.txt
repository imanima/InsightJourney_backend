**[10:00]**  
Dr. Harper Torres: Good morning, Alex. It's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**[10:05]**  
Alex: Hi, Harper. Thanks. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Work has been particularly stressful, especially with that recent launch. I still feel like I’m stuck in this loop of doubt and perfectionism.  

Dr. Harper: That sounds tough. You mentioned last time feeling some pressure to meet high standards, and that it’s been affecting your confidence. Can you tell me more about what’s been coming up for you this week?  

**[10:10]**  
Alex: Yeah, I’ve been obsessing over every detail on my latest project—trying to get everything just right. But no matter how much I tweak, I feel like I’m never enough. It’s like I’m waiting for that perfect moment when I’ll feel confident, but it never comes.  

Dr. Harper: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where perfectionism fuels self-doubt, and that doubt keeps you from feeling confident. Have you noticed specific triggers that set off these feelings?  

Alex: Definitely. Whenever I see someone else’s work—like in design communities or on Twitch—I start thinking I’m not good enough. That I’ll never measure up or lead in my field. It’s like comparing myself constantly.  

Dr. Harper: That comparison can be really harsh, especially when it triggers feelings of imposter syndrome. Last time, we talked about recognizing these thoughts as they happen. Have you been able to catch yourself in those moments?  

Alex: I try, but it’s hard. Sometimes I catch myself thinking, “They’re better than me,” or “I shouldn’t even bother trying to lead.” I know these are distorted thoughts, but knowing that doesn’t always make them go away.  

Dr. Harper: That’s an important insight—that awareness alone isn’t always enough. Remember, cognitive restructuring isn’t about eliminating these thoughts entirely but challenging their accuracy. For example, when you think, “I’m not good enough,” what evidence do you have for and against that?  

Alex: Well, I do have some wins—I led a project last month that was well-received, and I’ve gotten positive feedback from my team. But then I think, “That was just luck,” or “Anyone could have done it better.”  

Dr. Harper: So, you're acknowledging some successes, but your inner critic is downplaying them. That’s common with perfectionists. Let’s try to reframe that thought. Instead of “It was luck,” maybe consider, “I contributed valuable skills that helped the project succeed.” How does that feel to you?  

Alex: (Pauses) Honestly, a bit uncomfortable. Like I’m dismissing my effort. But I see your point—focusing on concrete contributions makes the success feel more real.  

Dr. Harper: Exactly. And over time, collecting evidence like this can help shift those core beliefs. You mentioned last session wanting to build confidence as a leader. How do you feel about your leadership skills now?  

Alex: I still doubt myself, especially in meetings. I hold back on sharing ideas because I think they’re not good enough or that I’ll be judged harshly. It’s frustrating because I know I have good ideas, but the fear blocks me.  

Dr. Harper: That’s a common experience. In our last sessions, we explored some mindfulness exercises to manage anxiety in real-time. Have you been practicing those?  

Alex: A little. I try to do the breathing exercises before meetings, but sometimes I forget or I get anxious last minute. It helps temporarily, but I want to get better at staying calm longer.  

Dr. Harper: That’s great awareness. Consistent practice can strengthen your ability to stay present. Also, we can work on some exposure techniques—gradually increasing your comfort in sharing ideas during meetings. Would you be willing to try that?  

Alex: Yeah, I think that could help. Maybe starting with small comments or suggestions, then gradually speaking up more.  

Dr. Harper: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, progress is about small steps, not perfection. How are your sleep habits? Last time, you mentioned sleep issues affecting your mood and focus.  

Alex: Yeah, I’ve been trying to stick to a routine, but late-night work and occasional insomnia still mess with me. I often wake up feeling exhausted, which makes it harder to manage anxiety during the day.  

Dr. Harper: Sleep hygiene is crucial, especially when dealing with anxiety and perfectionism. Have you tried any specific techniques, like limiting screen time before bed or using relaxation apps?  

Alex: I’ve cut down on screens an hour before bed, and I’ve been using a meditation app, but sometimes I get caught up in work or brainstorming sessions late into the night.  

Dr. Harper: That’s understandable, especially with your workload. Let’s set a goal for you to establish a more consistent wind-down routine—perhaps a 30-minute period of relaxing activities without screens. We can also explore scheduling your work hours to prevent late-night work sessions.  

Alex: That sounds reasonable. I think I need to set clearer boundaries. Sometimes I work late because I feel like I have to prove myself, but I realize that’s only making things worse.  

Dr. Harper: Recognizing that pattern is a big step. Setting boundaries aligns with your goal of building healthier work-life balance. Over the next week, I’d like you to implement the wind-down routine and note any changes in your sleep and anxiety levels.  

Alex: Will do. Also, I’ve been tracking my mood and sleep with the app you recommended, and it’s helpful to see patterns.  

Dr. Harper: That’s excellent. Data can be a powerful tool for seeing progress and identifying triggers. We’ll review that together next week.  

**[10:40]**  
Dr. Harper: To summarize, your action items are: practice cognitive restructuring by collecting evidence of your successes, continue mindfulness exercises before meetings, gradually increase your participation in discussions, establish a consistent sleep routine, and monitor your mood and sleep patterns. Does that sound manageable?  

Alex: Yes, that sounds good. I feel more focused now knowing what specific steps to take.  

Dr. Harper: Great. Remember, change takes time, and every small step counts. We’ll review your progress next week and adjust as needed. Anything else you want to discuss today?  

Alex: Not right now. Thanks, Harper. I appreciate the guidance.  

Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Alex. Keep up the good work, and I’ll see you next week. Have a restful day.
