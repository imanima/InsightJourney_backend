**[10:00]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?  

**Alex:** Hey, Harper. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days are better, but I still catch myself spiraling into perfectionist thoughts, especially when I’m preparing for big projects.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s quite common with perfectionism. Last time, we talked about noticing those automatic thoughts that fuel your anxiety. Have you had any opportunities to observe those thoughts during your work or outside?  

**Alex:** Yeah, I’ve been trying to catch myself when I start doubting my skills—like during the last client presentation, I kept thinking I’d mess up, even though I had prepared well. It’s like this voice saying I’m not good enough.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a great step—recognition. Remember, the core belief here seems to be “I have to be perfect to be accepted or successful.” Let’s explore that a bit. When you notice that voice, what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts it?  

**Alex:** Well, the evidence against it is pretty clear. I’ve delivered successful projects before, and my team relies on me. But the feeling of not being enough still lingers, especially when I compare myself to others online or in communities.  

**[10:10]**  
**Dr. Torres:** It sounds like comparison is a significant trigger for you. That’s very common among creators and designers—especially when you stream your process or share your work publicly. How does that comparison affect your confidence?  

**Alex:** It kills it. I see these designers who are so polished, with huge followings, and I think, “Why am I even here?” It’s like I’m constantly measuring myself against a moving target.  

**Dr. Torres:** That makes sense. And that comparison often feeds into your perfectionism, right? Wanting everything to be perfect before sharing or feeling like you’re not enough if it’s not. Have you noticed any patterns in your work habits or feelings when that happens?  

**Alex:** Yeah, I tend to overwork, obsess over tiny details, which ironically makes me less satisfied. Sometimes I stay late trying to fix a pixel or tweak a layout, even when I know I should just move on.  

**[10:20]**  
**Dr. Torres:** That’s a common cycle—perfectionism leading to overwork and burnout. Let’s try a quick exercise. I want you to imagine a recent situation where you felt this way. Can you describe it briefly?  

**Alex:** Sure. Last week, I was finalizing a feature design for a client, and I kept tweaking it until late at night, even after I had already received positive feedback. I kept thinking I could improve it, but I was exhausted.  

**Dr. Torres:** And how did that impact you afterward?  

**Alex:** I felt drained, anxious about whether I’d done enough, and I was worried I’d miss something important. It also made me doubt whether I was cut out for leadership, since I couldn’t let go of small details.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s insightful. The perfectionism is not just about the work but also about your beliefs about competence and leadership. Let's challenge that. What would you say to your friend or a colleague if they shared this experience?  

**Alex:** I’d probably tell them to cut themselves some slack, that no one is perfect and that overthinking can be counterproductive.  

**Dr. Torres:** Exactly. It’s often easier to see these patterns from an outside perspective. So, a key part of our work is to internalize that same compassion for yourself. Next, I’d like to introduce a cognitive restructuring technique—thought challenging. When those perfectionist thoughts come up, you ask yourself: “Is this thought true? What’s the evidence? What’s a more balanced perspective?”  

**Alex:** Okay, I can try that. It sounds helpful, especially when I’m caught in that cycle.  

**[10:30]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Perfect. Now, considering your goal to build confidence, how do you feel about your leadership abilities overall?  

**Alex:** Honestly, I still doubt myself a lot. I think I’m worried about not being taken seriously or making mistakes that could hurt the team. But I also recognize I’ve been stepping up more recently, like leading meetings and giving feedback.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s a great observation. Progress often happens in small steps. I want you to start collecting evidence of your leadership—positive feedback, successful projects, moments where you’ve handled challenges well. We can build a “confidence portfolio” from that.  

**Alex:** I like that idea. It might help me see that I am more capable than I sometimes believe.  

**[10:40]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Absolutely. Also, since work-life balance is still a concern, how are you managing boundaries around your design work?  

**Alex:** It’s still a challenge. I find myself checking emails or design tools late at night, partly out of fear I’ll fall behind. I’ve tried setting a strict end time, but then I get anxious about leaving things unfinished.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s understandable. Have you considered implementing a sleep hygiene routine or mindfulness practices to help detach from work at the end of the day?  

**Alex:** I’ve thought about it, but I haven’t been consistent. I do try to do a quick meditation sometimes, but I get distracted or forget.  

**Dr. Torres:** Consistency is key. Let’s set a small, manageable goal: tonight, try a 5-minute mindfulness practice before bed, focusing on your breath. It can help signal to your brain that it’s time to relax and disconnect. Would you be willing to try that?  

**Alex:** Yeah, I can do that. Seems doable.  

**[10:50]**  
**Dr. Torres:** Great. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on your tracking progress. How are you feeling about using the mood tracker and sleep metrics since our last session?  

**Alex:** Honestly, I’ve been more aware of my moods and triggers, especially on days I notice I’m overworking or comparing myself. Seeing the data helps me realize how much those thoughts impact my mood and sleep.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s wonderful. Data can be very powerful in validating your experiences and guiding your interventions. Keep noting these patterns, and we’ll review them next time.  

**Alex:** Sounds good. I feel like I’m starting to see some progress, even if it’s small.  

**Dr. Torres:** That’s exactly right—small steps lead to meaningful change. You’re doing great, Alex. For next week, focus on practicing the thought challenge when perfectionist thoughts arise and the mindfulness routine at night. How does that sound?  

**Alex:** It sounds manageable. I’ll give it a shot. Thanks, Harper.  

**Dr. Torres:** You’re welcome. I look forward to hearing how it goes. See you next week!
