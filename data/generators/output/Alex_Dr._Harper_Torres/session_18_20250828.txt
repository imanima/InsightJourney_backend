[10:00] Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

[10:02] Alex: Hey, Harper. Honestly, it's been a bit up and down. The week started pretty anxious after the recent launch failure, but I think I’m starting to settle into it.

[10:05] Dr. Harper: That’s understandable. Launch setbacks can really shake our confidence. Did anything specific happen this week that triggered those feelings?

[10:07] Alex: Yeah, I kept replaying the launch in my head, noticing all the things I could’ve done differently. It’s like this constant loop of "I should’ve known better" or "I’m not cut out for this."

[10:10] Dr. Harper: That sounds exhausting. When you notice those thoughts, how do they affect your mood or physical sensations?

[10:12] Alex: I feel tense, a bit nauseous sometimes, and my mind just won’t shut off. It’s like I’m stuck in a negative feedback loop.

[10:15] Dr. Harper: It’s good that you’re aware of those sensations. Last time, we talked about core beliefs around perfectionism and competence. Do you think those thoughts about the launch relate to those beliefs?

[10:17] Alex: Definitely. I’ve always believed I have to be perfect at my job, or I’ll be seen as a failure. When I mess up or don’t meet my own standards, it feels like I’m confirming that belief.

[10:20] Dr. Harper: That’s a very common pattern, especially for high-achievers. Let’s explore that belief a bit. What’s the evidence that supports the idea "I have to be perfect to be successful"?

[10:23] Alex: Well, I guess I’ve always gotten praise for my attention to detail, and I’ve been told I’m a high performer. So, I’ve internalized that perfectionism is part of my identity.

[10:25] Dr. Harper: And what about evidence that contradicts that? Are there times when imperfection or mistakes led to growth or success?

[10:28] Alex: Yeah, I mean, I’ve had projects where I missed a detail or made a typo, and I still managed to get positive feedback overall. Sometimes, those mistakes even helped me learn faster.

[10:30] Dr. Harper: Excellent. Recognizing that evidence can help challenge the absolute nature of your belief. How does it feel to consider that perfection isn’t the only path to success?

[10:33] Alex: It’s a bit freeing, honestly. But it’s hard to shake that deep-seated belief, especially when I see others in my field being so confident and seemingly flawless.

[10:35] Dr. Harper: Comparing yourself can definitely fuel perfectionism and imposter feelings. Remember, everyone has their struggles, even if it’s not visible. Have you noticed any recent moments where you felt confident or competent despite setbacks?

[10:37] Alex: Yeah, actually. After the launch, I spent time reviewing what went wrong, and I came up with some solid improvements. I felt proud of that problem-solving process.

[10:40] Dr. Harper: That’s a great example of resilience. Let’s try to build on that. How might you reframe your thoughts the next time you notice self-criticism about your work?

[10:43] Alex: Maybe I could remind myself that mistakes are part of growth, and I don’t have to be perfect to be valuable.

[10:45] Dr. Harper: Perfect. That’s a cognitive restructuring step. Now, I’d like us to incorporate a mindfulness practice to help you observe these thoughts without judgment. Would you be open to a quick guided exercise?

[10:48] Alex: Yeah, I’d like that.

[10:50] Dr. Harper: Great. I’ll guide you through a brief mindfulness breathing exercise. Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in... (pauses briefly) and exhale slowly. Focus on the sensation of your breath—the coolness as you inhale, the warmth as you exhale. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath. Let’s do that for a minute.

(They pause during the exercise)

[10:55] Dr. Harper: How do you feel after that?

[10:56] Alex: Calmer, actually. It’s easier to observe my thoughts without immediately reacting to them.

[10:58] Dr. Harper: That’s the power of mindfulness. It can help create space between your thoughts and your reactions. As homework, I’d like you to practice this breathing exercise daily, especially when you notice anxiety creeping in after work or during projects.

[11:00] Alex: Will do. Also, I think I want to track my anxiety levels and confidence over the week. Maybe I can use that app we talked about?

[11:03] Dr. Harper: Excellent idea. Using the app to monitor your mood and confidence can provide valuable data. We can review your progress in our next session. Do you feel ready to implement these strategies?

[11:05] Alex: Yeah, I do. It’s been helpful to see that my beliefs are more flexible than I thought. I appreciate the tools.

[11:07] Dr. Harper: I’m glad. Remember, change takes time, and progress isn’t always linear. We’ll keep working on building your confidence and managing perfectionism step by step. For next week, let’s also explore your work-life boundaries more deeply—how you can set limits that support your well-being.

[11:09] Alex: Sounds good. Thanks, Harper. I feel more hopeful today.

[11:10] Dr. Harper: That’s wonderful to hear. Keep practicing the mindfulness, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Have a great day, Alex.

[11:12] Alex: You too. Bye!
