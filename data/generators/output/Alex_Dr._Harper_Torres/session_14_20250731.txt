**[10:00]**  
Dr. Torres: Hi Alex, good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

Alex: Hey, Dr. Torres. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve been feeling more anxious about the upcoming project deadlines, but I’ve also been trying to use some of the mindfulness techniques we discussed.  

Dr. Torres: That’s great to hear you’re actively practicing mindfulness. Do you notice any specific moments when the anxiety spikes?  

Alex: Yeah, mostly when I get stuck on a design detail and start overthinking if it’s “good enough.” I catch myself spiraling into perfectionism, like I’m afraid I’ll be judged harshly if I don’t get it exactly right.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a very common trigger for perfectionism. We’ve touched on this before — can you recall any particular core beliefs that might be fueling these feelings?  

Alex: I think I’ve been thinking a lot about how I’m perceived. Like, if I mess up, it means I’m not competent enough, and I’ll lose my spot at the startup. That fear of failure feels really intense sometimes.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a powerful insight. It sounds like there’s a belief that your worth is tied to perfection and success. Would you be willing to challenge that belief today, maybe look at evidence that contradicts it?  

Alex: Yeah, I’m open to that. I know logically I’ve done good work before, but in the moment, it’s hard to feel confident.  

Dr. Torres: Absolutely. Cognitive restructuring can help with that. Let’s explore some evidence together. Can you think of a recent project where you felt you did well, despite some imperfections?  

Alex: Well, last week, I launched a feature update that initially had some bugs, but overall, users responded positively, and I fixed the issues quickly. I kept reminding myself that perfect isn’t necessary — just effective.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a great example. You managed the situation effectively, and it shows that imperfection doesn’t mean failure. How does that align with your core belief about worth and perfection?  

Alex: It kind of contradicts it. I guess I’ve been so focused on avoiding mistakes that I forget I can handle them when they happen.  

Dr. Torres: Exactly. Part of our work is to create a more balanced view—seeing mistakes as opportunities to learn rather than threats. Have you noticed any shifts in how you judge your work or yourself during these episodes?  

Alex: I think I’ve been more lenient, at least internally. When I catch myself obsessing over tiny details, I try to step back and ask, “Is this really important in the grand scheme?” Sometimes it helps.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a helpful strategy. Mindfulness combined with cognitive questioning can reduce the intensity of perfectionistic thoughts. How about your sleep? Have you been able to maintain your sleep hygiene routines?  

Alex: Mostly, yeah. I’ve been sticking to a consistent bedtime, but some nights I still lie awake worrying about work stuff. I notice that when I do my breathing exercises before bed, I fall asleep faster.  

Dr. Torres: That’s excellent. Sleep hygiene is a crucial part of managing anxiety and perfectionism. Let’s incorporate a brief mindfulness practice now to reinforce that. Would you like to do a quick grounding exercise?  

Alex: Sure, I’d like that.  

**[10:10]**  
Dr. Torres: Great. I want you to find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose... (pause) and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath. Notice the rise and fall of your chest. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breathing.  

( pause for a couple of breaths )  

Now, identify three things you can see around you, two things you can hear, and one thing you can feel.  

**[10:20]**  
Alex: Okay. I see my laptop, a cup of tea, and my plant. I hear my clock ticking and some distant traffic. I feel the texture of my sweater.  

Dr. Torres: Perfect. This grounding exercise helps anchor you in the present moment, which can be helpful when anxious thoughts start to spiral. How do you feel after doing that?  

Alex: A bit calmer, actually. It’s like a quick reset.  

Dr. Torres: That’s exactly right. Consistent use of techniques like this can build resilience over time. Now, thinking about building confidence in your leadership role—what small step could you take this week to reinforce that?  

Alex: I think I could volunteer to lead a team meeting or present a new idea to my colleagues. It feels a bit intimidating, but I want to push myself a little.  

Dr. Torres: That’s a fantastic goal. Taking small, manageable risks will help you build that confidence gradually. How confident do you feel about doing that?  

Alex: Honestly, I’m nervous, but I know it’s the right move. I just need to remind myself that mistakes aren’t the end of the world.  

Dr. Torres: Exactly. Remember, every step you take is part of the process of growth. Before our next session, I’d like you to reflect on any thoughts or feelings that come up when you try to lead or speak up. We’ll explore those further.  

Alex: Will do. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I think I’m starting to see some progress.  

Dr. Torres: That’s wonderful to hear. Keep practicing these skills, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. For next time, we’ll continue working on confidence-building and explore any new challenges that arise.  

Alex: Sounds good. Thanks again.  

**[10:30]**  
Dr. Torres: You’re very welcome. Have a great week, Alex.  

Alex: You too. See you next week.
