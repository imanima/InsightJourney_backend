**[10:00]**  
Dr. Harper Torres: Hi Alex, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  

**[10:03]**  
Alex: Hey, thanks. Um, I’d say overall, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. Work has been pretty stressful, especially after that failed launch last week. I keep replaying everything in my head—what I should have done differently.  

**[10:07]**  
Dr. Harper: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way after a setback. How are you holding up emotionally?  

**[10:10]**  
Alex: Honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty anxious — like I’m not good enough, and maybe I don’t belong in this role. It’s that imposter syndrome creeping back in. Plus, I’ve been working late trying to fix things, so I’m also pretty exhausted.  

**[10:12]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a lot to carry at once. It’s common to experience those feelings after a failure, especially when you’re pushing yourself hard. You mentioned imposter syndrome—can you tell me about the specific thoughts that come up?  

**[10:16]**  
Alex: Sure. I keep thinking, “I only got here because of luck,” or “I don’t really have what it takes to lead,” even though I’ve been successful in the past. I guess I feel like I’m faking it, and if I slip up, everyone will see I’m not qualified.  

**[10:20]**  
Dr. Harper: Those are very familiar thoughts for many perfectionists and high-achievers. Let’s try to examine them. Can we look at the evidence for and against these beliefs? For example, what evidence do you have that suggests you don’t have what it takes?  

**[10:24]**  
Alex: Well, I did get the promotion, and I’ve been leading projects for a few years now. But, after the launch failure, I feel like my skills are suddenly questionable. It’s like I forget all the wins.  

**[10:27]**  
Dr. Harper: Exactly. It’s common to focus on the recent setback and overlook past successes. That’s called cognitive bias—specifically, selective abstraction. Remember, your promotion and experience are evidence of your capabilities. Now, how about the thoughts that say “I only got here because of luck”? Is there any evidence to support or challenge that?  

**[10:30]**  
Alex: I guess that I did work really hard to get my last project out on time, and I’ve built a good reputation in my community. So, maybe luck isn’t the main factor.  

**[10:33]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a great insight. It’s important to recognize your effort and skills. Now, considering these facts, how might you reframe that thought from “I only got here by luck” to something more balanced?  

**[10:36]**  
Alex: Maybe, “I’ve worked hard and earned my position, even if I made a mistake this time. It doesn’t invalidate my skills or achievements.”  

**[10:39]**  
Dr. Harper: Perfect. That’s a strong, balanced statement. Reframing like this can help reduce the intensity of those negative feelings over time. Have you noticed any other specific triggers lately?  

**[10:42]**  
Alex: Yes, actually. When I see feedback from my team or clients—especially if it’s critical—I tend to spiral into self-doubt. I get anxious about not being good enough or about losing respect.  

**[10:45]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a very common trigger, especially for perfectionists. How do you usually respond to critical feedback?  

**[10:48]**  
Alex: I tend to take it personally and start questioning my entire competence. Sometimes I even avoid reading feedback altogether.  

**[10:51]**  
Dr. Harper: That avoidance can reinforce anxiety. A helpful step might be to approach feedback with a curious mindset—seeing it as information rather than as a judgment of your worth. Would you be open to trying a mindfulness exercise right now to help manage these reactions?  

**[10:55]**  
Alex: Yeah, I think that could help.  

**[10:56]**  
Dr. Harper: Great. Let’s do a quick grounding exercise. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on your breath, noticing the sensation of air entering and leaving your body. As thoughts come up—like worries about feedback—acknowledge them without judgment, then gently bring your attention back to your breath.  

**[11:02]**  
(After a minute of silence)  

**[11:03]**  
Dr. Harper: How do you feel now?  

**[11:04]**  
Alex: A bit more centered, actually. It’s easier to breathe and not get caught up in those thoughts.  

**[11:06]**  
Dr. Harper: Excellent. Using mindfulness regularly can help you observe those automatic thoughts without immediately reacting to them, which reduces anxiety over time. Now, let’s shift gears a bit. You mentioned wanting to build confidence in your leadership. What specific steps have you thought about?  

**[11:09]**  
Alex: Well, I want to start setting clearer boundaries at work—like not checking emails late at night—and also develop a more sustainable design process so I don’t burn out.  

**[11:12]**  
Dr. Harper: Those are great goals. Setting boundaries can definitely help with work-life balance and reduce perfectionist tendencies. How about confidence-building? Any ideas there?  

**[11:15]**  
Alex: I’ve been considering keeping a “success journal”—writing down daily or weekly wins, no matter how small. That way, I can remind myself of my capabilities.  

**[11:18]**  
Dr. Harper: That’s a very effective technique—gratitude and success journaling can reinforce positive self-perceptions. Would you be willing to try that over the next week?  

**[11:21]**  
Alex: Yes, I think I can do that. It sounds helpful.  

**[11:23]**  
Dr. Harper: Great. To wrap up today, let’s review your action items. First, practice the mindfulness exercise when you notice anxious or critical thoughts. Second, start your success journal and aim to write in it at least three times this week. And third, work on reframing those core negative beliefs about your abilities.  

**[11:27]**  
Alex: Got it. Thanks, Dr. Torres. I feel like I have some concrete tools now, which is helpful.  

**[11:29]**  
Dr. Harper: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, setbacks are part of growth, and you’re making progress. We’ll review how these strategies work for you next week. Anything else you’d like to discuss today?  

**[11:32]**  
Alex: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.  

**[11:34]**  
Dr. Harper: You’re welcome, Alex. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress.
