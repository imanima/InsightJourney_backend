Topic: Inner critic, compassion, holding multiple truths
Duration: 30 minutes
Anxiety Level: 6.5/10

00:00 — T: Welcome back. How was it trying to connect with your partner last week?

00:05 — A: Surprisingly… good. I tried the “5% more” thing. One night I just said, “I feel off today, not sure why.” And she looked at me and said, “Thanks for saying that.” No pressure, no fixing. Just a moment of closeness.

00:25 — T: That’s beautiful. What was it like for you?

00:30 — A: Kind of scary — but freeing. Like I was being honest without needing a solution. And it didn’t break anything.

00:45 — T: That’s a big win. Vulnerability as connection, not danger.

00:50 — A: Yeah. But I also noticed the inner critic show up hard after. It said stuff like, “You’re being dramatic,” or “She’s going to get tired of your feelings.”

01:10 — T: That voice — when it shows up, what’s its tone? What does it sound like?

01:15 — A: Cold. Dismissive. Like a boss that’s never satisfied.

01:25 — T: And what does it want for you, if anything?

01:30 — A: I think it wants me to be safe. To not get hurt. It thinks if I just keep performing and hiding, I won’t be rejected.

01:50 — T: That’s really wise. What would it be like to say: “Thanks for trying to protect me… and I’m okay right now”?

01:58 — A: That’s… interesting. Like a dialogue. I’ve never thought to thank that voice.

02:10 — T: That’s one way we soften it — not by shutting it down, but by acknowledging its purpose and choosing a new response.

02:20 — A: I like that. So I can still hear it… but I don’t have to obey it.

02:30 — T: Exactly. You’re not erasing it — you’re becoming the adult in the room.

02:40 — A: Damn. That actually makes me feel stronger. Less like I’m being bullied by my thoughts.

Notice the critic’s voice — thank it for trying to help

Respond with: “I’m safe right now, and I don’t need to perform to be loved.”

Keep practicing small emotional truths with partner — 5% more connection
