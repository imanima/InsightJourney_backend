00:00 — Therapist (T): Hey Alex. Good to see you again. How was this past week?

00:05 — Alex (A): Hey. It was… surprisingly meaningful. I did both of the things we talked about. And they were small, but they hit deeper than I expected.

00:18 — T: That’s great to hear. Do you want to start with what you shared with your partner?

00:22 — A: Sure. I told her I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and that I haven’t known how to talk about it. I was expecting her to get frustrated or shut down… but she didn’t. She just listened. And said, “I had no idea you were holding so much.”

00:42 — T: That’s a powerful moment. How did it feel?

00:47 — A: Like… air finally came into the room. I didn’t say everything, but I was honest. And I didn’t fall apart. And she didn’t leave. That surprised me.

01:05 — T: That’s really beautiful, Alex. What do you think allowed you to take that risk?

01:10 — A: I think… doing that check-in with myself the day before helped. I had this moment where I felt anxious and instead of trying to push it away, I just sat with it. I realized the anxiety wasn’t about work — it was about being scared to be seen.

01:30 — T: That’s a huge realization. That the anxiety is about being seen — not just being busy.

01:40 — A: Yeah. And I started wondering: what if my anxiety isn’t just some random thing… but a signal?

01:50 — T: I love that reframe. What do you think your anxiety has been trying to protect you from?

01:55 — A: (pause)
Failure. Rejection. Not being enough. I think it’s trying to keep me safe — by keeping me small and busy and quiet.

02:15 — T: That’s a powerful insight. The anxiety isn’t your enemy — it’s an overactive protector.

02:25 — A: Yeah. But the part that hit me the most was realizing that I’ve been outsourcing my self-worth. To productivity. To other people’s reactions. To whether I’m “doing enough.”

02:45 — T: That sounds like a core belief surfacing. Something like, “I’m only okay if I’m achieving.”

02:52 — A: Exactly. And I’m exhausted by it. There’s always another thing I “should” be doing. Learn this AI tool. Hit this deadline. Fix this relationship. I can’t keep up.

03:10 — T: That sounds like an impossible race — one where the finish line keeps moving.

03:20 — A: Yes. And I’m realizing I’ve never asked, “What do I actually want? What do I value — outside of being useful?”

03:35 — T: That’s a beautiful question. Do you want to explore that right now?

03:40 — A: Yeah. I think… I want peace. Not boredom — but peace. A sense that I don’t have to prove something every second.

03:58 — T: And if you had that peace, what would change?

04:05 — A: I think I’d be more present. I’d listen better. I’d feel more grounded. Maybe even more creative.

04:20 — T: That’s really powerful. What part of you do you think would resist that peace?

04:25 — A: The inner critic. The part that says I’m lazy, or that I’ll fall behind. It whispers stuff like, “If you rest, you lose.”

04:40 — T: And who taught that part to speak that way?

04:45 — A: (pause)
Probably the world. My family. Hustle culture. School. Tech. It’s everywhere.

05:05 — T: Makes sense. That voice helped you succeed — but now it might be costing you your well-being.

05:15 — A: Yeah. I’m starting to see that. I don’t want to kill that part… I just want to turn the volume down.

05:30 — T: Beautifully said. And what would support that in the week ahead?

05:35 — A: Maybe noticing when the voice shows up. Like — actually pausing and naming it: “Oh, that’s the critic.” And then choosing not to obey it automatically.

05:50 — T: I love that. It builds space between the voice and your reaction.


06:05 — T: So, for this week:

Notice and name the inner critic when it shows up — just name it, no need to fight it.

Ask yourself: What would peace look like in this moment?

How does that sound?

06:20 — A: That feels really good. Like something I can actually do. And maybe even want to do.

06:30 — T: I’m so glad to hear that. You’re building a whole new relationship with your anxiety — not through force, but through curiosity.

06:40 — A: Thanks. That actually gives me some hope.

06:45 — T: I’ll see you next week. And well done, Alex — this work is deep.
