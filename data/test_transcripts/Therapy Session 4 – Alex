Duration: 30 minutes
Anxiety Level: 7/10

00:00 — Therapist (T): Hey Alex. Good to see you. How was your week?

00:04 — Alex (A): It was okay. I actually caught myself a few times in that old spiral — the “I need to do more or I’ll fall behind” thing. But instead of following it all the way, I paused.

00:20 — T: That’s great. What happened when you paused?

00:25 — A: I heard the critic. Loud and clear. Stuff like: “Everyone else is learning this new AI tool. If you don’t catch up, you’re done.” But this time, I just said: “Okay, I see you.” And weirdly, that helped.

00:45 — T: That’s huge. You didn’t try to fight the voice — you just noticed it.

00:50 — A: Yeah. It lost some of its power when I named it. But… underneath it, there’s still this fear. Like I’m on the edge of a cliff. If I don’t keep learning, adapting, producing — I fall.

01:10 — T: That sounds terrifying. What do you imagine is at the bottom of that cliff?

01:15 — A: (pause)
Being irrelevant. Worthless. Alone.

01:30 — T: That hits deep. It’s not just about learning tools — it’s about losing your place in the world.

01:40 — A: Yeah. And that’s what freaks me out. I don’t know who I am if I’m not the “useful one.” The guy who gets things done.

01:55 — T: You’ve built a strong identity around being capable, efficient, needed.

02:00 — A: Yeah. It worked for years. Got me jobs. Made people rely on me. But now… it’s like my skills are being replaced. And I’m scared that means I’m being replaced.

02:20 — T: That’s an incredibly human fear. Being left behind. Not mattering.

02:30 — A: Exactly. It’s like I have to re-define myself. But I don’t know how.

02:40 — T: Would you be open to sitting with that question together — not solving it right now, but just exploring?

02:45 — A: Yeah… let’s try.

02:50 — T: If you weren’t defined by your output, what else might be part of who you are?

03:00 — A: (pause)
I think… I’m someone who listens deeply. I love connecting dots. I get excited when I see someone light up with an idea. That’s always been my favorite part of design — not just the product, but the human behind it.

03:25 — T: That’s beautiful. That’s a whole part of your identity that has nothing to do with productivity — and everything to do with presence and curiosity.

03:40 — A: Yeah. I guess I just don’t give it as much value. Like, I don’t get paid for being curious or grounded.

03:55 — T: True — but it’s the foundation for how you show up in the world. And it might be exactly what helps you reinvent.

04:05 — A: That’s interesting. So instead of racing to stay ahead of AI, maybe I start asking, “What kind of human do I want to be in this world?”

04:20 — T: That’s a powerful reframe. What would happen if you focused on that this week?

04:30 — A: I think I’d slow down. Be more intentional. Maybe give myself permission to not learn a new tool this week — and just notice how that feels.

04:45 — T: Would that be a bold act of self-trust?

04:50 — A: (smiles)
Yeah. It kind of would.

05:00 — T: Then maybe that’s our experiment. Not because learning is bad — but because your value doesn’t rise and fall with your output.

05:15 — T: So, here’s what I’m hearing for this week:

Give yourself permission not to chase a new skill — just for this week.

Reflect on this question: “What kind of human do I want to be in a world full of machines?”

How does that feel?

05:30 — A: Surprisingly calm. A little scary — but mostly grounding.

05:40 — T: You’re doing deep, honest work, Alex. I can see your system is slowly shifting from urgency to awareness.

05:50 — A: Thanks. That means a lot. I think I’ve been craving this kind of slowness for years.

05:58 — T: Then let’s keep building on it.
