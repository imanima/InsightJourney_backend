Topic: People-pleasing at work, fear of saying no, first boundary experiment
Duration: 30 minutes
Anxiety Level: 6.8/10

00:00 — Therapist (T): Hey Alex. Good to see you again. How did it feel to slow down last week?

00:05 — Alex (A): Honestly? Really good. I didn’t try to learn anything new. I even closed a few tabs that were just “AI stuff I should probably know.” And I felt lighter. Still scared sometimes, but more in control.

00:25 — T: That sounds like a big shift — from chasing to choosing.

00:30 — A: Yeah. But something else came up. I noticed how often I say “yes” at work just to avoid conflict — even when I know I’m at capacity.

00:45 — T: That’s a great awareness. What happens in you when someone asks for something?

00:50 — A: My gut says “no,” but my mouth says “sure.” I don’t even pause. It’s automatic.

01:05 — T: What do you think you’re trying to protect when you say yes?

01:10 — A: Honestly? I don’t want to disappoint anyone. Or look lazy. Or unhelpful. I guess I’m afraid people will stop trusting me.

01:25 — T: That makes sense. It’s like saying no = being unsafe.

01:30 — A: Exactly. But then I’m overwhelmed and silently resentful. Which isn’t fair to me or anyone else.

01:50 — T: So part of you says yes for safety — but it costs you authenticity.

02:00 — A: Yeah. I even wrote in my journal: “I don’t know how to protect my time without guilt.”

02:15 — T: That’s such an important sentence. Would you be open to experimenting with a pause — like a buffer between the request and your response?

02:25 — A: Like saying, “Let me check and get back to you”?

02:30 — T: Exactly. It creates space for choice instead of a reflex.

02:40 — A: I can try that. Even just once. It feels doable.

02:50 — T: Beautiful. And what’s one kind way to say no if you needed to?

02:55 — A: Maybe: “I’d love to help, but I don’t have the capacity this week. Could we look at another time?”

03:10 — T: That’s clear and respectful. And honest.

03:20 — T: So for this week:

Use a “pause” when a request comes in.

Try saying a respectful no once — even to something small.

03:35 — A: Okay. I want to try that. I want to start backing myself.

03:45 — T: That’s the work. And you’re already doing it.
