00:00 — T: Hey Alex. How did it go with the boundaries this week?

00:05 — A: I actually did it. Once. Someone asked me to take on a task — and I said, “Let me check where I’m at and get back to you.” My heart was pounding, but… they said, “Sure, no rush.” And nothing bad happened.

00:25 — T: Amazing. How did that feel in your body after?

00:30 — A: Kind of electric. Like… wait, I’m allowed to do that? I didn’t realize how much tension I carry around needing to say yes.

00:45 — T: So you reclaimed a bit of agency.

00:48 — A: Yeah. It made me realize how much I operate from reaction. I’ve been in survival mode for so long, I forgot what it’s like to choose.

01:05 — T: That’s powerful. And how did that open up space in your life this week?

01:10 — A: Funny you ask. One evening I didn’t work late… and I started sketching again. Just for fun. No project. Just lines and shapes and color.

01:25 — T: Wow. That sounds like an old part of you waking up.

01:30 — A: Yeah. It felt good. No goal, no outcome. I forgot how much I love creating for the sake of it.

01:45 — T: That’s the beginning of something important. Creativity as restoration — not productivity.

01:55 — A: Yeah. I didn’t realize how much I missed me. Not the efficient me. The curious me.

02:10 — T: What would it look like to nurture that part of you this week?

02:15 — A: Maybe I block out 30 minutes just for “play.” No phone, no tasks. Just create or explore whatever comes up.

02:30 — T: That sounds like sacred time. A small rebellion against the pressure to always be “useful.”

02:40 — A: I like that. A rebellion through presence.

Schedule 30 minutes of “creative play” time this week — no productivity allowed

Keep pausing before responding to requests at work
