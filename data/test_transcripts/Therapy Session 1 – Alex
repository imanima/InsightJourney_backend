Anxiety Level: 8/10

00:00 — Therapist (T): Hi Alex. I’m glad you’re here. What brought you in today?

00:06 — Alex (A): Hey. Uh… yeah. I guess I’m just really overwhelmed. It’s kind of everything — work, relationships, my head. It’s all a bit much lately.

00:18 — T: Sounds like there’s a lot on your plate. What feels most present right now?

00:25 — A: Work. Definitely work. I’m in tech — product design. And everything is changing so fast. AI is doing like half the stuff I used to be good at. I feel like I’m just trying to stay afloat, but every week there’s some new tool I’m “supposed to” master.

00:45 — T: That sounds exhausting. Like you’re running just to stay in the same place.

00:51 — A: Yeah. And I’m tired. I don’t feel sharp anymore. I used to love solving problems, being creative. Now I just feel behind. Like I’m slowly becoming… obsolete?

01:15 — T: That’s a heavy word — obsolete.

01:20 — A: Yeah. I don’t say it lightly. But it’s there. That fear. Like I’m not evolving fast enough. And it’s not just about skills. It’s like this pressure to reinvent who I am.

01:40 — T: That’s a lot to carry. What does that pressure feel like in your body?

01:47 — A: Tight chest. I notice I clench my jaw all the time. Even in sleep. Sometimes I just stare at the screen — like my brain’s buffering.

02:05 — T: So your body is holding all this urgency, even when your mind goes blank.

02:12 — A: Yeah. And then there’s guilt. Like, “Come on, you should be doing more. Everyone else is figuring it out.” It never stops.

02:25 — T: Can I ask — when did you first start noticing this shift?

02:30 — A: Probably around six months ago. That’s when my team started using AI tools for wireframes and mockups. I thought it was cool at first. But now… it’s like the part of my work I loved is slowly disappearing.

02:55 — T: That makes sense. It’s not just a task being automated — it’s part of your identity.

03:05 — A: Exactly. And I haven’t really said that out loud to anyone. I just try to act like I’m excited. But inside… I feel like I’m losing something important.

03:25 — T: I appreciate you saying that here. What’s it like to name it?

03:30 — A: Honestly? Kind of relieving. I didn’t realize how much I was holding in.

03:45 — T: That’s a good place to start. You mentioned “everything” earlier — is anything else adding to the overwhelm?

03:55 — A: My relationship. We’ve been off for months. She says I’m distant. That I shut down. And she’s right. But I don’t even know how to explain what’s going on. I just feel… foggy.

04:20 — T: That makes sense. When we’re overwhelmed, it’s hard to be present anywhere — even with people we care about.

04:30 — A: Yeah. It’s like I’m never really “here.” Even when I’m home, my mind is still at work. Or just… buzzing with anxiety.

04:50 — T: What do you usually do when that buzz shows up?

04:55 — A: Scroll. Numb out. Or I just dive back into work. Sometimes I just crash and sleep. I’m either wired or completely checked out.

05:10 — T: So there’s a pattern of going between overdrive and shutdown?

05:15 — A: Yeah, that’s exactly it.

05:25 — T: If we were to slow down and zoom out for a second — what do you think all of this is trying to tell you?

05:35 — A: (Pause)
Maybe… that something’s not working. That I can’t keep running on fumes.

05:55 — T: That sounds like a really honest insight.

06:00 — A: It feels scary to admit. Like… if I stop pushing, everything might fall apart.

06:15 — T: I hear that. And also, if you keep pushing the way you are now — what’s the cost?

06:25 — A: I don’t know… Me?

06:30 — T: Yeah. That’s something we can explore together — how to show up for your life without losing yourself in the process.

06:45 — A: That would help. Because right now, I feel like I don’t even know who I am without being useful or productive.

07:00 — T: Thank you for naming that. That’s a deep belief — and it sounds like it’s ready to be looked at.

07:10 — A: I think so. I’m tired of carrying it alone.


07:30 — T: As we wrap up, is there something small you’d be willing to try this week? Just as a check-in with yourself?

07:40 — A: Maybe… journaling? I haven’t done it in years, but I could try writing for five minutes before bed.

07:55 — T: That’s a great start. Not to fix anything — just to listen to what’s already inside.

08:05 — A: Yeah. I can try that.

08:10 — T: Wonderful. Let’s check in next time to see what comes up. And again — I really appreciate how much you shared today.

08:20 — A: Thank you. I feel a little lighter.
