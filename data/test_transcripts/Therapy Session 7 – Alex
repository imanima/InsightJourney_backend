Therapy Session 7 – Alex
Topic: Emotional withdrawal, fear of vulnerability in relationship
Duration: 30 minutes
Anxiety Level: 7/10 (spike due to relational stress)

00:00 — Therapist (T): Hi Alex. How have things been this week?

00:05 — Alex (A): A bit heavier. My partner and I had a tough conversation. She told me she’s been feeling really alone — like I’m physically there, but emotionally gone.

00:20 — T: That sounds painful to hear. How did that land for you?

00:25 — A: Honestly… I knew it was coming. I’ve been feeling it too. But hearing her say it made it real. And I didn’t know what to say. I just shut down again.

00:40 — T: What happens inside you when she says something vulnerable like that?

00:45 — A: My chest tightens. I want to fix it. But I also panic, like… I don’t know how to give her what she needs. And then I get quiet, and she feels rejected.

01:00 — T: Sounds like a loop — one where both of you feel alone in different ways.

01:08 — A: Yeah. I think I confuse emotional presence with performance. Like I need to show up perfectly, or not at all.

01:20 — T: That’s a big insight. Do you remember where that pressure to “get it right” comes from?

01:25 — A: Probably childhood. My dad was distant, like I mentioned. But when he was engaged, it was only when I was doing well. There was no room for mess.

01:40 — T: So you learned that being emotionally messy = being unsafe or unworthy of love.

01:45 — A: Yeah. And I think I’ve brought that into my relationship. I protect myself by disconnecting.

02:00 — T: That makes sense. But it sounds like the cost is intimacy — the very thing you both want.

02:10 — A: Yeah. I want to change that. I just don’t know how to let my guard down without feeling exposed.

02:20 — T: What if the goal wasn’t to be fully open right away — but just 5% more available? Would that feel more manageable?

02:30 — A: Yeah. That feels possible.

02:35 — T: What would 5% more connection look like this week?

02:40 — A: Maybe just… sharing how I feel in real time. Even if it’s simple. Like “I feel overwhelmed right now.” No explanation. Just that.

02:55 — T: That would be huge. That kind of honesty builds connection, not perfection.

Practice sharing one real-time emotion with partner this week — without fixing

Reflect in journaling: “What part of me is scared to be seen?”

Pause when shutting down and name: "I’m feeling overwhelmed, not disconnected."

Emotional Shift: From avoidance → beginning vulnerability
Anxiety Level: Spikes to 7/10 but grounded through relational insight
