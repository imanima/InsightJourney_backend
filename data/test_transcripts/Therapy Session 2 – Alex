00:00 — Therapist (T): Hey Alex. Welcome back. How was the week?

00:05 — Alex (A): Hey. Um… honestly, rough. The journaling helped, kind of. But it also brought up a lot. I didn’t realize how much I’ve been avoiding.

00:20 — T: I’m glad you tried it. What did you notice as you wrote?

00:25 — A: Mostly that I don’t know what I’m feeling half the time. It’s like… my mind is just noise. And when I try to write it down, I don’t even know where to begin. But one thing that came up a few times was this voice in my head saying, “Don’t be weak.”

00:50 — T: That sounds like a strong message. Do you recognize where that voice might come from?

00:58 — A: Probably my dad. He wasn’t cruel or anything, just… distant. Stoic. Always busy. I learned early not to “bother” people with my emotions.

01:20 — T: So it felt safer to keep things in.

01:25 — A: Yeah. Still does, to be honest. Even now, when I get anxious or overwhelmed, I don’t want to talk about it. I just shut down.

01:40 — T: That shutting down — what does it look like in your day-to-day?

01:45 — A: At work, I stay quiet. I overthink before saying anything. At home, it’s worse. My partner keeps saying I’m not “there” — and she’s not wrong. I come home and I just… disappear.

02:10 — T: Disappear — that’s a powerful word. What happens internally when you disconnect like that?

02:18 — A: It’s like I flatten. I lose color. I’m physically present but emotionally… nowhere. I numb out with YouTube, Reddit, whatever.

02:40 — T: So part of you is protecting yourself from overwhelm by going numb.

02:45 — A: Yeah. And then I feel guilty. Because I know she wants connection. But I don’t even know how to show up for her when I can’t feel anything myself.

03:10 — T: That cycle sounds painful — numbness, guilt, more shutdown.

03:20 — A: Exactly. It’s like… I’m afraid that if I open the door to what I’m really feeling, it’ll be too much. That I’ll fall apart.

03:40 — T: What’s your relationship like with falling apart?

03:45 — A: I hate it. I avoid it at all costs. I’ve always been the “stable one.” The reliable one. If I lose that, then what am I?

04:05 — T: So there’s a part of you that believes emotional expression threatens your sense of self.

04:12 — A: Yeah. Or that it’ll make other people pull away. Like I’ll be too much.

04:30 — T: Can I offer something here?

04:33 — A: Please.

04:35 — T: I wonder if there’s a version of you that’s not weak because of the feelings — but strong because you’re finally turning toward them. Even if just in here.

04:50 — A: That’s… hard to believe. But it’s nice to hear. I guess coming here is the first time I’ve really tried that.

05:10 — T: That in itself is strength. You're breaking a long pattern.

05:20 — A: Yeah. And weirdly, even though I still feel anxious, there’s a part of me that feels... kind of relieved after I talk. Like I’m not hiding.

05:35 — T: That’s really important. Relief tells us something is being met — maybe even something that’s been ignored for a long time.

05:50 — A: I think I’m realizing that I don’t just need rest. I need permission. To stop performing. To just be human.

06:10 — T: That’s a beautiful insight. What would “being human” look like for you this week?

06:20 — A: (Pause)
Maybe letting myself feel something and not fix it. Like… if I’m sad, just let that be okay.

06:40 — T: Would you be open to making that an intention? One moment this week where you check in and let yourself name how you feel — without trying to solve it.

06:52 — A: Yeah. I can try that. Even once would be a win.

07:05 — T: Definitely. And you don’t need to do it perfectly. This is about noticing, not performing.

07:15 — A: That helps. Also… I think I want to talk to my partner. Just share a little. Not everything — but maybe say that I’m trying.

07:30 — T: That’s a big step. What would you want her to know?

07:35 — A: That I’m not ignoring her. I’m just overwhelmed. And scared. And I’m working on it.

07:50 — T: Beautiful. Sounds like a part of you really wants to reconnect — and be honest.

08:00 — A: Yeah. I’m tired of hiding.

08:15 — T: So here’s what I’m hearing for this week:

One moment of letting yourself feel, without fixing.

A gentle check-in with your partner — not a big talk, just a real one.

Does that feel doable?

08:30 — A: Yeah. I want to try.

08:35 — T: I’m proud of the work you’re doing already. This isn’t easy — but it’s meaningful.

08:45 — A: Thanks. I didn’t expect to feel this safe this quickly. It means a lot.

08:55 — T: I’m glad. I’ll see you next week.
