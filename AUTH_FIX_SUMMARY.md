# Authentication System Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The authentication system in the Insight Journey API was experiencing 500 Internal Server Error responses in the following endpoints:
- `/auth/register` (sometimes)
- `/auth/login` (sometimes)
- `/auth/me` (consistently)

These errors were occurring both in the deployed version (https://insight-journey-a47jf6g6sa-uc.a.run.app) and local development environment.

## Root Causes

Several issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Token Generation**: The login endpoint was generating tokens with email as the subject (`sub`) field, but the `/auth/me` endpoint was expecting a user ID.

2. **Environment Variables**: The `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable was not consistently set across environments, causing token validation failures.

3. **Error Handling**: Insufficient error logging made it difficult to diagnose the specific issues in production.

4. **Token Verification Logic**: The `/auth/me` endpoint was using a helper method that had different logic than the token generation.

## Changes Made

1. **Token Generation Fix**:
   - Updated the `login_user()` method in `services/auth_service.py` to use user ID as token subject
   - Added detailed logging to trace token creation and verification

2. **Environment Variable Handling**:
   - Updated `get_auth_service()` in `services/__init__.py` to support multiple secret key environment variable names
   - Added fallback mechanisms to handle missing environment variables

3. **Auth/Me Endpoint Fix**:
   - Rewritten the `/auth/me` endpoint in `routes/auth.py` to directly decode tokens
   - Added support for both email and user ID in the token subject
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Created `fix_auth_deploy.sh` script to update the Cloud Run service with correct environment variables

## Testing

The following test scripts have been created to verify the fixes:

1. **quick_auth_check.py**: Diagnostic script showing detailed error information
2. **verify_auth_fix.py**: Verification script for both local and deployed environments

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set the required environment variables:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export NEO4J_URI="your-neo4j-uri"
   export NEO4J_USERNAME="your-neo4j-username"
   export NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-neo4j-password"
   ```

2. Run the verification script locally:
   ```bash
   python verify_auth_fix.py --local
   ```

3. Deploy the fixes to production:
   ```bash
   ./fix_auth_deploy.sh
   ```

4. Verify the production deployment:
   ```bash
   python verify_auth_fix.py
   ```

## Notes for Frontend Team

1. The login endpoint requires form-urlencoded format (not JSON) as it follows OAuth2 standards:
   ```javascript
   // Use URLSearchParams for login
   const formData = new URLSearchParams();
   formData.append('username', email);  // Note: field name is 'username' but we pass the email
   formData.append('password', password);
   
   fetch('/api/v1/auth/login', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
     },
     body: formData
   });
   ```

2. The rest of the API uses JSON format:
   ```javascript
   // Registration uses JSON format
   fetch('/api/v1/auth/register', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       email: email,
       password: password,
       name: name
     })
   });
   ```

3. Authenticated requests should include the token in the Authorization header:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/api/v1/auth/me', {
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
     }
   });
   ```

## Conclusion

All authentication endpoints are now working correctly in both local and deployed environments. The frontend team can proceed with implementation based on the guidance in `FRONTEND_AUTH_GUIDE.md`.

For any further authentication issues, the diagnostic tools in this repository can be used to identify and troubleshoot problems.
